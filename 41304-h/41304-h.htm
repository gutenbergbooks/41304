<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The history of England's Parliament is the history of the
English people. To the latter it must consequently
prove a source of never-failing interest. That it does
so is clearly shown by the long list of writers who have
sought and found inspiration in the subject. To add to their
number may perhaps seem an unnecessary, even a superfluous,
task. This volume may indeed be likened to that "Old
Piece in a New Dress" to which Petyt compared his <i>Lex
Parliamentaria</i>. "These things, men will say, have been
done before; the same Matter, and much the same Form,
are to be found in other Writers, and this is but to obtrude
upon the World a vain Repetition of other men's observations."
But although the frank use of secondhand matter
cannot in this case be denied, it is to be hoped that even the
oldest and most threadbare material may be woven into a
fresh pattern, suitable to modern taste.</p>

<p>In these democratic days a seat in either House of
Parliament is no longer the monopoly of a single privileged
class: it lies within the reach of all who can afford the luxury
of representing either themselves or their fellows at Westminster.
It is therefore only natural that the interest in
parliamentary affairs should be more widely disseminated
to-day than ever. It does not confine itself to actual or
potential members of both Houses, but is to be found in the
bosom of the humblest constituent, and even of that shadowy
individual vaguely referred to as the Man in the Street.
Though, however, the interest in Parliament is widespread, a
knowledge of parliamentary forms, of the actual conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
business in either House, of the working of the parliamentary
machine, is less universal.</p>

<p>At the present time the sources of information open to
the student of parliamentary history may roughly be regarded
as twofold. For the earnest scholar, desirous of examining
the basis and groundwork of the Constitution, the birth and
growth of Parliament, the gradual extension and development
of its power, its privileges and procedure, the writings of all
the great English historians, and of such parliamentary
experts as Hatsell, May, Palgrave, Sir William Anson, Sir
Courtenay Ilbert and Professor Redlich, provide a rich mine
of information. That more considerable section of the
reading public which seeks to be entertained rather than
instructed, can have its needs supplied by less technical but
no less able parliamentary writers&mdash;Sir Henry W. Lucy,
Mr. T. P. O'Connor, Mr. MacDonagh&mdash;none of whom,
as a rule, attempts to do more than touch lightly upon
fundamental Constitutional questions.</p>

<p>The idea of combining instruction with amusement is one
from which every normal-minded being naturally shrinks:
the attempt generally results in the failure either to inform
or entertain. There does, however, seem to be room for
a volume on the subject of Parliament which shall be
sufficiently instructive to appeal to the student, and yet not
so technical as to alarm or repel the general reader. It is
with the object of supplying the need for such a book that
the following pages have been written.</p>

<p>An endeavour to satisfy the tastes of every class of reader
and at the same time to cover the whole field of parliamentary
history within the limits of a single volume, must necessarily
lead to many errors of admission as well as of omission.
The material at the disposal of the author is so vast, and the
difficulties of rejection and selection are equally formidable.
Much of the information given must perforce be so familiar
as to appear almost hackneyed. Many of the stories with
which these pages are sprinkled bear upon them the imprint
of extreme old age; they are grey with the cobwebs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
antiquity. But while the epigram of the past is too often
the commonplace of the present, the witty anecdote of one
generation, which seems to another to plumb the uttermost
abysses of fatuity, may yet survive to be considered a
brilliant example of humour by a third. The reader, therefore,
who recognises old favourites scattered here and there
about the letterpress, will deride or tolerate them in accordance
with the respect or contempt that he entertains for the
antique.</p>

<p>I cannot lay claim to the possession of expert parliamentary
knowledge, though perhaps, after close upon fifteen
years' residence within the precincts of the Palace of Westminster,
I may have acquired a certain intimacy with the life
and habits of the Mother of Parliaments. For my facts
I have to a great extent relied upon the researches of
numerous parliamentary writers, past and present, to whom
I have endeavoured to express my indebtedness, not only in
copious footnotes, but also in the complete list of all sources
of information given at the end of this volume. I wish to
express my thanks to the many friends and acquaintances
who have so kindly assisted me with their counsel and
encouragement; to Mr. Kenyon, Mr. Sidney Colvin and the
officials of the Print Room and Reading Room at the British
Museum; to Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty, Garter King-at-Arms;
to Mr. Edmund Gosse, Librarian of the House of Lords,
and other officers of both Houses. My thanks are particularly
due to Sir Henry Graham, Clerk of the Parliaments, who
placed his unique parliamentary experience at my disposal,
and whose invaluable advice and assistance have so greatly
tended to lighten and facilitate my literary labours.</p>

<h2>THE MOTHER OF PARLIAMENTS</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>PARLIAMENT AND PARTY</h3>


<p>It has been asserted that the different social conditions of
various peoples have their origin, not so much in climate
or parentage, as in the character of their governments.
If that be true, there is little doubt that the social conditions of
England should compare most favourably with those of sister
nations. But the admirable form of Government to which
Englishmen have now long been accustomed, did not come
into existence in the course of a single night. "The resemblance
between the present Constitution and that from which
it originally sprang," says an eighteenth-century writer, "is
not much nearer than that between the most beautiful fly
and the abject worm from which it arose."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And the conversion
of the chrysalis into the butterfly has been a slow and
troublesome process.</p>

<p>Montesquieu, who was an earnest student of the English
Constitution, after reading the treatise of Tacitus on the
manners of the early Germans, declared that it was from them
that England had borrowed her idea of political government.
Whether or no this "beautiful system was first invented in
the woods,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as he says, it is certain that we owe the primary
principles of our existing constitution to German sources.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
They date back to the earliest days of the first settlements of
Teutons on the Kentish shores.</p>

<p>To the word "parliament" many derivations have been
assigned. Petyt explains the name as suggesting that every
member of the assembly which it designates should <i>parler le
ment</i> or speak his mind.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Another authority derives it from
two Celtic words, signifying to "speak abundantly"&mdash;a
meaning which is more applicable in these garrulous times
than it was in days when debate was often punctuated by
lengthy intervals of complete silence.</p>

<p>Whatever its derivation, the word no doubt referred
originally to the "deep speech" which the kings of old held
with their councillors. The first mention of it, in connexion
with a national assembly, occurs in 1246, when it was used
by Matthew Prior of a general convocation of English barons.
About thirty years later it appears again in the preamble to
the First Statute of Westminster. It has now come to be
employed entirely to describe that combination of the Three
Estates, the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal and the
Commons, which with the Crown form the supreme legislative
government of the country.</p>

<p>The ancient Britons possessed a Parliament of a kind,
called the <i>Commune Concilium</i>. Under the Heptarchy each
king in England enjoyed the services of an assembly of wise
men&mdash;or Witenagemot, as it was called&mdash;which advised him
upon matters of national importance. The Witan sat as a
court of justice, formed the Council of the chiefs, and could
impose taxes and even depose the King, though the latter too
often took the whole of their powers into his own hands.
When the separate kingdoms became united, their different
Councils were absorbed into the one great Gemot of Wessex.
This, in Anglo-Saxon times, was a small body, consisting of
less than a score of Bishops, a number of Ealdormen (or
heads of the different shires), and certain vassal members.
This senate was undoubtedly the germ of all future systems
of Parliamentary government; and though for the first two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
hundred years after the Conquest there is no historical record
of the meeting of any body corresponding to our present
Parliament, from the days of the Witenagemot to our own
times the continuity of our national assemblies has never
been broken.</p>

<p>The parliamentary historian suffers much from the lack
of early records. None were kept in Anglo-Saxon times, the
judgments of the Witan being only recorded in the memory
of the judges themselves. The Rolls of Parliament begin
with the year 1278&mdash;though the first mention of the Commons
does not occur until 1304&mdash;and somewhere about Edward III.'s
reign was written a volume called the "Vetus Codex" or "Black
Book" which contains transcripts of various parliamentary
proceedings. At the time of the restoration of Charles II.,
Prynne, the antiquarian, set himself the task of exhuming old
records, and catalogued nearly a hundred parcels of ancient
writs, private petitions, and returns. The MSS. which he
worked upon were so dirty that he could not induce any one
else to clean them, and was forced to labour alone. Wearing
a nightcap over his eyes, to keep out the dust, and fortified
by continual draughts of ale, he proceeded cheerfully with this
laborious undertaking upon which he finally based the book
which has made him famous.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The House of Commons Journals begin with Edward VI.
those of the Lords at the accession of Henry VIII. And
though during the early part of the seventeenth century
speeches were reported at some length in the Commons
Journals, in the Lords only the Bills read and such matters
are recorded.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The material to work upon is consequently of
an exiguous nature, until we reach the later days of freedom
of the Press and publicity of debates.</p>

<p>The history of Parliament proper divides itself naturally
into four distinct periods. The first may be said to stretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
from the middle of the thirteenth to nearly the end of the
fifteenth century; the second dates from the accession of
Henry VII., and extends to the Revolution of 1688. The
remaining century and a half, up to the Reform Bill of
1832, forms the third period; and with the passing of that
momentous Act commences the last and most important
epoch of all.</p>

<p>During the first two periods of parliamentary history, the
whole authority of government was vested in the Crown;
during the third it gradually passed into the possession of the
aristocracy: and it is only within the last century that the
people, through their representatives in the House of
Commons, have gained a complete political ascendency.</p>

<p>From the days of the absolute monarchy of Norman
sovereigns until the reign of King John, the Crown, the
Church, the Barons, and the people, were always struggling
with each other; in that reign the three last forces combined
against the King. The struggle was never subsequently
relaxed, but it took over six centuries to transfer the governing
power of the country from the hands of one individual to
that of the whole people.</p>

<p>Prior to the reign of Henry III., no regular legislative
assembly existed, though the King would occasionally
summon councils of the great men of the land for consultative
purposes. In William the Conqueror's time the ownership
of land became the qualification for the Witenagemot, and
the National Council which succeeded that assembly thus
became a Council of the King's feudal vassals, and not necessarily
an assembly of wise men. When, however, Simon de
Montford overthrew Henry III. at Lewes, he summoned a
convocation which included representative knights and
burgesses, and the parliamentary system, thus instituted, was
subsequently adopted by Edward I. "Many things have
changed," says Dr. Gardiner in his "History of England," "but
in all main points the Parliament of England, as it exists at
this day, is the same as that which gathered around the great
Plantagenet." The first full Parliament in English history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
may, therefore, be said to have been summoned by Edward I.
on November 13, 1295, and represented every class of the
people.</p>

<p>Parliament thereafter gradually resolved itself into two
separate groups; on the one hand the barons and prelates,
representing the aristocracy and the Church, on the other the
knights and burgesses, representing the county freeholders,
citizens and boroughfolk. The former constituted a High
Court of Justice and final Court of Appeal; the chief duty of
the latter lay in levying taxes, and they were not usually
summoned unless the Crown were in need of money. These
two component groups originally sat together, forming a
collective assembly from which the modern Parliament has
gradually developed.</p>

<p>In the early days of Parliament the Lords came to be
regarded as the King's Council, over which he presided in
person; the Commons occupied a secondary and insignificant
position. The power of legislating was entirely in the hands
of the King, who framed whatever laws he deemed expedient,
acting on the humble petition of his people. The Crown thus
exercised absolute control over Parliament, and the royal yoke
was not destined to be thrown off for many hundreds of years.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward III., the meetings of Parliament
were uncertain and infrequent; its duration was brief. Three
or four Parliaments would be held every year, and only sat
for a few weeks at a time. The King's prerogative to dissolve
Parliament whenever he so desired&mdash;"of all trusts
vested in his majesty," as Burke says, "the most critical
and delicate"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was one of which mediæval monarchs freely
availed themselves in the days when Parliament had not
yet found, nor indeed realised, its potential strength.</p>

<p>During the reigns of the Tudors and Stuarts, the power
of the Crown was still supreme, though many attempts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
made to weaken it. This second period of history, between
1485 and 1688, was a time of peculiar political stress, in
which Parliament and the Crown were engaged in a perpetual
conflict. Kings maintained their influence by a mixture
of threats and cajolery which long proved effective. In 1536,
for instance, we find Henry VIII. warning the House of
Commons that, unless some measure in which he was
interested were passed, certain members of that assembly
would undoubtedly lose their heads.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The Stuart kings were in the habit of suborning members
of both Houses, by the gift of various lucrative posts or the
lavish distribution of bribes. It was ever the royal desire
to weaken Parliament, and this end was attained in a variety
of ways. In the early part of the seventeenth century, we
hear of Charles I. summoning to Hampton Court certain
members whose loyalty he distrusted or whose absence
from Parliament he desired. On one such occasion the
Earls of Essex and Holland refused to obey his command,
saying that their parliamentary writ had precedence of any
royal summons&mdash;an expression of independence for which
they were dismissed from the Court.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In the time of Charles II. a definite system of influencing
members of Parliament by gifts of money was first framed,
Lord Clifford, the Lord Treasurer, being allowed a sum of
£10,000 for the purpose. The fact of holding an appointment
in the pay of the Crown was in itself considered
sufficient to bind a member to vote in accordance with the
royal will. In 1685, when many members who were in the
Government service threatened to vote against the Court,
Middleton, the Secretary of State, bitterly reproached them
with breach of faith. "Have you not a troop of horse in
his Majesty's service?" he asked of a certain Captain
Kendall. "Yes, my lord," was the reply, "but my brother
died last night and left me £700 a year!"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>Andrew Marvell has drawn a vivid but disagreeable
picture of the Parliament which was summoned immediately
after the Restoration. Half the members of the House of
Commons he described as "court cullies"&mdash;the word "to
cully" meaning apparently to befool or cheat&mdash;and in "A
list of the Principal Labourers in the great Design of Popery
and Arbitrary Law," gives a catalogue of the names of over
two hundred members of Parliament who received presents
from the Court at this time.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The independence of Parliament was first asserted by
that staunch old patriot Sir John Eliot, who, during the
reign of Charles I., declared to the Commons that they
"came not thither either to do what the King should command
them, nor to abstain when he forbade them; they
came to continue constant, and to maintain their privileges."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
But in spite of such brave words, the power of the Crown
was not finally subdued until the Revolution.</p>

<p>The downfall of the Monarchy at the time of the
Commonwealth was followed by the temporary abolition of
both Lords and Commons, the latter disappearing in
company with Cromwell's famous "bauble." The Protector
then proceeded to call together a body of "nominees," one
hundred and forty in number, who represented the various
counties in proportion to the amount of taxes each of these
contributed. Of the seven nominees supplied by London,
Praise God Barebones, a Fleet Street leather merchant, gave
his name to the Parliament thus assembled. Cromwell
also created a new House of Lords, numbering about sixty.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>With the Restoration the Crown resumed much of its
former power. In 1682 the publisher of a reprint of
Nathaniel Bacon's "Historical Discourse," which declared
that Kings could "do nothing as Kings but that of Right
they ought to do," and that though they might be "Chief
Commanders, yet they are not Chief Rulers," was outlawed
for these treasonable statements. It was not, indeed, until
the Revolution of 1688 that the royal influence was curtailed,
so small a revenue being allowed to William III. that the
ordinary expenses of government could not be defrayed
without assembling Parliament.</p>

<p>The attendance of the King in Parliament had been
usual in early days, but the Commons always deprecated
the presence of the Sovereign in their midst. Charles I.
affords the only example of a monarch attending a debate
in the Lower House, when on that famous 4th of January,
1642, he marched from Whitehall to Westminster, with the
intention of arresting the five leading members, Hampden,
Pym, Holles, Haselrig and Strode, authors of the Grand
Remonstrance, whom he had caused to be impeached on
the preceding afternoon. The House had been put upon its
guard by Lady Carlisle, and on the eventful day, a French
officer, Hercule Langres, made his way to Westminster and
warned Pym and his colleagues of the approach of the royal
troops. When therefore the King arrived he found that his
birds had already flown, and was compelled to retire empty-handed,
amid cries of "Privilege!" from members of the
outraged assembly.</p>

<p>In those times the desire of the Commons was to keep
the Crown as ignorant as possible on the subject of their
doings. The habit of providing the King with a daily
account of Parliamentary proceedings did not come into
fashion until the end of the eighteenth century, when the
House was no longer afraid of the royal power.</p>

<p>The Lords have never objected as strongly as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Commons to the royal presence. Charles II. often found
the time hang heavy on his hands, and would stroll down to
the Upper House, "as a pleasant diversion." He began by
sitting quietly on the Throne, listening to the debates. Later
on he took to standing by the fireplace of the Lords, where
he was soon surrounded by many persons anxious to gain the
royal ear, and thus "broke all the decency of that House."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Since the accession of Queen Anne, however, no Sovereign
has been present in Parliament, save at the opening or closing
ceremonies. But long after kings had ceased to attend Parliament
in person they continued to attempt the control of
its proceedings. George III. finally brought matters to
a head by his perpetual interference with the affairs of the
Commons, and caused the passing of that momentous resolution,
moved by Dunning on April 6, 1780, "that the influence
of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be
diminished," which disturbed if it could not vex Dr. Johnson.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Between 1688 and 1832 political life in England was
excessively corrupt. Parliament had grown to a certain
extent independent of the Crown, but had not yet learnt
to depend upon public opinion. It was consequently a
difficult body to deal with, and had to be managed by a
system of open bribery which first showed itself most conspicuously
in the shape of retaining fees paid to Scottish
members.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In 1690 the practice of regularly bribing members
of the House of Commons was undertaken by the Speaker,
Sir John Trevor, on behalf of the Tory party. In Queen
Anne's reign a statesman paid thousands of pounds for the
privilege of being made Secretary of State, and a few years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
later we find Sir Robert Walpole assuring a brother of Lord
Gower that he knew the price of every man but three in the
House of Lords.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Bribery no longer emanated direct from the Crown, but
was practised vicariously by the King through his ministers.
They might object to the system, but, as King William once
said to Bishop Burnet, they had to do with "a set of men
who must be managed in this vile way or not at all."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Macaulay likens the Parliament of that time to a pump which,
though it may appear dry, will, if a little water is poured into
it, produce a great flow. So, he says, £10,000 given in
bribes to Parliament would often produce a million in
supplies.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Even Pelham, a man of unblemished reputation
in private life, saw the absolute necessity of distributing
bribes right and left. And in 1782 we find Lord North
writing to George III. to remind him that "the last general
election cost near £50,000 to the Crown, beyond which
expense there was a pension of £1000 a year to Lord
Montacute and £500 a year to Mr. Selwyn for their interest
at Midhurst and Luggershall."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Seats in Parliament were regularly bought and sold, the
price varying from £1500 to as much as £7000. Flood, the
Irish politician, purchased a seat in the English House of
Commons for £4000. The notoriously corrupt borough of
Gatton was publicly advertised for sale in 1792, with the
power of nominating two representatives for ever, described
by the auctioneer as "an elegant contingency."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This same
seat was sold in 1831 by Sir Mark Wood for the huge sum
of £60,000, and the purchaser's feelings may well be imagined
when, under the Reform Act of the following year, the
borough was disfranchised and rendered worthless.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p><p>Parliament was for long in the hands of a few rich persons.
Wealthy individuals would buy property in small boroughs
in order to increase their political influence, and cared little
for the fitness of the representatives whom they nominated.
The story is told of a peer being asked who should be
returned for one of his boroughs, and casually mentioning a
waiter at White's Club whom he did not even know by name.
The waiter was duly elected, and, for aught we know, may
have made a most worthy and excellent member of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In 1815 the House of Commons contained 471 members
who were the creatures of 144 peers and 123 Commoners.
Sixteen representatives were Government nominees; and
only 171 members were actually elected by the popular vote.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Five years later nearly half the House were returned by
peers.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The passing of the Septennial Act in 1716, in place of the
Triennial Act of 1694, though meeting with much hostile
criticism,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> had helped to further that growing independence of
both Lords and Crown which was the chief aim of the
Commons. Before the Triennial Act Parliament could only
be dissolved by the Crown. Under the Triennial Act it
suffered a natural death three years after the day on which
it was summoned. The Septennial Act lengthened that
existence by a further period of four years. Members were
no longer kept in a state of perpetual anticipation of an
imminent General Election; they were no more harassed by
the fear of losing their seats at any moment. With security
came strength, but purity was a long time in following. The
Septennial Act, says Lecky, gave "a new stability to English
policy, a new strength to the dynasty, and a new authority to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the House of Commons." But it certainly did not tend to
decrease the corruption which was then rampant both in
Parliament and in the country.</p>

<p>The whole body politic was, indeed, utterly rotten, and it
was only considered possible to maintain the ministerial influence
by a system of disciplined Treasury corruption. The
secret service money with which votes were bought was in the
control of the Prime Minister, and Walpole is said to have
stated that he did not care a rap who made Members of Parliament
so long as he was allowed to deal with them after
they were made. The produce of the taxes descended in
fertilizing showers upon the proprietors, the agents and the
members for boroughs. For them, as Lord John Russell said,
the General Election was a state lottery in which there was
nothing but prizes. "The elector of a borough, or a person
he recommends, obtains a situation in the Customs; the
member of Parliament obtains a place in the Mediterranean
for a near relation; the proprietor of the borough obtains
a peerage in perspective; and the larger proprietor, followed
by his attendant members, shines in the summer of
royal favour, with a garter, a regiment, an earldom, or a
marquisate."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> So ingrained had this idea become in the
public mind that the Duke of Wellington is supposed to
have asked ingenuously, on the abolition of the rotten
boroughs, "How will the King's Government be carried
on?"</p>

<p>Several ineffectual efforts had from time to time been
made to slay the monster of corruption. From the days of
Cromwell the question of Parliamentary reform had been
anxiously urged by many statesmen, notably Lord Shaftesbury
and Pitt, of whom the latter introduced reformative measures
in 1781, 1782 and 1785. But though Pitt, the first Prime
Minister who did not retain any of the public money for
distribution among his friends and supporters, managed to
reduce "places" worth over £200,000, after the American
War, there still remained any number of inflated pensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and sinecures in the gift of the Government,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and it was not
until Parliament came to be controlled entirely by public
opinion that the change from corruption to purity took place.
But notwithstanding many flaws in theory and blots in
practice, the English Parliamentary Constitution prior to the
Reform Bill was, as Mr. Gladstone called it, one of the
wonders of the world. "Time was its parent, silence was its
nurse.... It did much evil and it left much good undone;
but it either led or did not lag behind the national feeling
and opinion."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> With the Reform Act of 1832, Parliament
advanced another stage in its career. The House of Commons
definitely shook itself free from the active corruption which
had so long impeded its movements.</p>

<p>The principle of Party Government, which now lies at the
very root of our parliamentary system, had its origin during
the second period of parliamentary history, and formed no
part of the constitutional scheme of earlier days.</p>

<p>In Queen Elizabeth's time two definite and distinct parties
arose, the one maintaining the privileges of the Crown, the
other upholding the interests of the people. In Stuart days
Cavaliers and Roundheads were followed by Court and
Country Parties, and in the year 1679, when the Exclusion Bill
was being bitterly debated, the distinctive names of "Whigs"
and "Tories" first came into existence. "Whig" was
originally a word applied to the lowland peasantry of the
West of Scotland; thence it came to mean Covenanters, and
so politicians who looked kindly upon Nonconformity.
"Tory" was an expression popularly used with reference to
the rebel Irish outlaws who harassed the Protestants; and
thus implied leanings towards Catholicism.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The growth of a respect for the people's rights forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
politicians to separate into two sections, and the schism
between the rival camps was still further emphasized by the
Revolution of 1688. Regular opposing parties do not, however,
seem to have existed in the Commons until the eighteenth
century, and the party system was not finally established
as a necessary element of constitutional government until the
reign of William III. Kings had hitherto chosen their
advisers irrespective of their political views. William III.
was, however, induced by the Earl of Sunderland to form a
Ministry from the party that held a majority in Parliament,
and thus became to a certain extent controlled by that
party.</p>

<p>There have always been, as Macaulay says, under some
name or other, two sets of men, those who are before their
age, and those who are behind it, those who are the wisest
among their contemporaries, and those who glory in being no
wiser than their great-grandfathers. But this definition of
the two great political parties of England can no longer with
justice be applied. The Tory of to-day is not at all the Tory
of two hundred years ago: indeed, he rather resembles the
Whig of Queen Anne's time. And though Disraeli continued
to use the word "Tory," and was never ashamed of it, it has
now gradually fallen into disuse, save as a term of reproach
on the lips of political opponents. A change of nomenclature
was adopted in 1832. The Tories became Conservatives, and
for the benefit of wavering Whigs it was proposed that the
latter should be known as Liberal-Conservatives, a name
which, as Lord John Russell remarked, expressed in seven
syllables what Whig expressed in one.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The term "Radical"
did not come into use until the days of the famous reformer,
Francis Place (1771-1854); his political predecessors contenting
themselves with the more modest name of Patriots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Called by whatever name is popular for the moment, either
party may now claim to come within the scope of Burke's
well-known definition as "a body of men united for promoting,
by their endeavours, the national interest upon some
particular principle in which they are all agreed."</p>

<p>Our modern parliamentary system comprises the party
spirit as its most vital element, and owes its success to the
fact of being government by party and not by faction.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
existence of an admittedly constitutional body perpetually
opposed to the Government of the day&mdash;"His Majesty's
Opposition," as it has been called since 1826&mdash;is now recognised
as a very necessary portion of the Parliamentary
machine. The principle of fairness to the minority is never
lost sight of, and expresses itself in many different ways.
When, for instance, the Leader of the Opposition gives notice
of a motion of censure on the Government, the latter consider
it their duty to accord their critics an early opportunity for its
discussion; and, generally speaking, the due consideration
of the rights of minorities is among the primary instincts of
party government. The excellent effects of this system are
obvious. Of the two ways of obtaining political adherents
the attachment of party is infinitely preferable to the attachment
of personal interest, formerly so prolific a source of
corruption. Party feeling may also be said to have created
general rules of politics, similar to a general code of morals
by which a man may "walk with integrity along the path
chosen by his chiefs, surrounded and supported by his
political colleagues."</p>

<p>Opposition is invaluable as providing a stern criticism of
the Government's policy; it can also very often be of service
to the cause it is intended to injure. It excites a keener
public curiosity, by directing attention to the motives of
those whom it suspects. And "the reproaches of enemies
when refuted are a surer proof of virtue than the panegyrics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of friends."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> That the system must possess certain disadvantages
is inevitable. It no doubt engenders animosity and
provokes violent contentions: it stimulates politicians to
impute to their opponents corrupt motives which they could
not for a moment imagine themselves capable of entertaining.
It may also on occasion tempt them to continue obstinately
in the support of wrong, because the admission of a mistake
would be hailed as a triumph for their enemies. "The best
cause in the world may be conducted into Faction," as Speaker
Onslow said; "and the best men <i>may</i> become party men, to
whom all things appear lawful, which make for their cause
or their associates."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But as a rule the game of politics is
played with commendable fairness and an absence of undue
acrimony. The Opposition, whose well-known duty it is "to
oppose everything, to propose nothing, and to turn out the
Government,"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> rarely makes its attacks the vehicle for
personal spite. Politicians of adverse views do not carry
their antagonism into private life, and off the stage of Parliament
the bitterest opponents are able to exist upon amicable
terms. Occasionally, however, political differences have been
the cause of ruptured friendship. When Burke made a
violent attack upon Fox, in 1791, on the Canada Bill, he
declared that if necessary he would risk the latter's lifelong
friendship by his firm and steady adherence to the British
Constitution. Fox leaned across and whispered that there
was no loss of friends. "Yes," replied Burke, "there <i>is</i> a loss
of friends. I know the price of my conduct. I have done
my duty at the price of my friend. Our friendship is at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
end!" So terminated an intimacy of twenty-five years'
standing. Such an incident may, nevertheless, be considered
exceptional, the relations of antagonists being usually of a
most harmonious kind. Sir Robert Peel and Lord John
Russell would often be seen together engaged in friendly
conversation. O'Connell once walked arm in arm down
Whitehall with Hughes Hughes, the member for Oxford,
whose head he had but recently likened to that of a calf.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
And the present Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition
are doubtless able to play bridge or golf together without
actually coming to blows. In spite, therefore, of much
criticism, what Emerson calls "that capital invention of
freedom, a constitutional opposition,"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> has been found to be
the most practical and satisfactory means of carrying on
government.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE HOUSE OF LORDS</h3>


<p>No constitutional principle has been so strongly criticised
and so freely abused as the one embodied in
the hereditary chamber which forms so important a
branch of our legislature. Pulteney labelled the House of
Lords a "hospital for invalids"; Burke contemptuously
referred to it as "the weakest part of the Constitution"; Lord
Rosebery has compared it to "a mediæval barque stranded
in the tideway of the nineteenth century." A more democratic
modern statesman, who doubtless hopes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"To build, not boast, a generous race;</span>
<span class="i0">No tenth transmitter of a foolish face,"</span>
</div>

<p>has declared the only legislative qualifications of peers to
consist in their being the first-born of persons possessing as
little qualifications as themselves. While another politician
cynically observes that they represent nobody but themselves,
and enjoy the full confidence of their constituents.</p>

<p>The House of Lords has long been the butt of the
political satirist, and parliamentary reformers have attacked
it for years patiently and persistently, hitherto without much
success. "We owe the English Peerage to three sources," said
a character in "Coningsby"; "the spoliation of the Church;
the open and flagrant sale of its honours by the elder
Stuarts; and the borough-mongering of our own times."
And this bitter criticism is often quoted to prove the weakness
of any form of hereditary government.</p>

<p>The suggestion that heredity can confer any peculiar
qualifications, rendering a person more fit than his fellows for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
parliamentary power, is no doubt illogical, but not more
so perhaps than a thousand other ideas which govern the
affairs of men. The form of government by majority, for
instance,&mdash;which Pope called "the madness of the many
for the gain of a few"&mdash;is obviously open to criticism.
Hereditary legislation has, at any rate in the eyes of its
supporters, the merit of having answered well enough in
practice, and, however theoretically indefensible, is not more
so than hereditary kingship. The Sovereign does not inherit
sagacity any more than the Duke of Norfolk, as Lord John
Russell justly observed, and it would be unwise as well as
unsafe to hang the Crown on the peg of an exception. It is
as well, however, to remember that the Sovereign is a constitutional
monarch whose powers nowadays are much restricted,
whereas the Lords have the right to exercise a legislative
veto the use of which kings have long since resigned.</p>

<p>Talent is not hereditary. No man chooses a coachman,
as the first Lord Halifax once remarked, because his father
was a coachman before him. But the descendant of a long
line of coachmen is likely to know more about the care of
horses than the grandson of a pork butcher, however eminent;
and the scion of a race of legislators is at least as fully qualified
for the duties of a legislator as many a politician whose chief
reason for entering Parliament is the desire to add the letters
M.P. to his name. Nevertheless, as has been recently pointed
out by tactless statisticians, the great men of the past have
but seldom bequeathed their admirable qualities to their
<i>eldest</i> sons, and in a list of modern statesmen will be found
but few of the names once famous in English history.</p>

<p>The necessity for a second chamber of some sort has
always been admitted, if only to prevent the other House
from being exposed to what John Stuart Mill calls "the
corrupting influence of undivided power," and Cromwell "the
horridest arbitrariness that was ever known in the world."
Few, however, of the most ardent admirers of the hereditary
system will pretend that the problem of a perfect bicameral
system is solved by the present House of Lords, though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
may doubtless claim that the cause of its failure does not rest
entirely upon its basis of heredity. "You might as well urge
as an objection to the breakwater that stems the unruly
waves of the sea, that it has its foundations deep laid in
another element, and that it does not float on the surface of
that which it is to control," said Palmerston, "as say that the
House of Lords, being hereditary, ought on that account to
be reformed."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>If age can confer dignity and distinction upon any
assembly, then must the House of Lords be peculiarly distinguished,
for it is certainly the most venerable as well as
the most antiquated of our Parliamentary institutions.</p>

<p>When Christianity became firmly established in England,
each king of the Heptarchy was attended by a bishop, whose
business it was to advise his royal master upon religious
questions, and who thus acquired the power of influencing
him in other matters as well. The minor kings were gradually
replaced by earls, who were summoned, together with their
attendant bishops, to the Witenagemot of the one ruling
sovereign of the country. An assembly of this nature was
held as far back as 1086, but it was more in the nature of a
judicial Court than a Parliament. It consisted of the Archbishop
of Canterbury and all other bishops, earls, and
barons, and was summoned to decide important judicial
cases. This Court, or <i>Curia Regis</i> as it was called, met at
different times and in divers places. It transacted other
business besides the judicial, and also corresponded to some
extent with the more modern <i>levée</i>. It was originally composed
of the Lords, the great officers of State, and some
others whom the king wished to consult.</p>

<p>The exact position which such nobles held in the great
Council of the land is not very definite. Immediately after
the Conquest an earldom appears to have been regarded as
an office; but it was not necessarily hereditary. Later on
the possession of lands, either granted direct by the Crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
or inherited, became a necessary qualification for the holder
of an earldom. The transfer of titles and property in early
days was a rough and ready affair, in which might played as
great a part as right. (When Edward I. required the old Earl
de Warrenne to produce his title deeds, the latter brought out
a rusty sword that had belonged to his ancestors. "By this
instrument do I hold my lands," he said, "and by the same
do I intend to defend them!") But with the natural idea of
the transference of land from father to son there developed
the principle of the natural hereditary descent of the title
dependent upon the possession of those lands.</p>

<p>The baronage did not come into existence until after
the Conquest. In the reign of Henry I. it was entirely composed
of foreigners from France. Barons held no regular
office, but their lands were transferred on the hereditary
principle. They owed military allegiance to the Crown, but
did not necessarily sit in Parliament unless summoned to
attend by the king. Such a summons was long regarded
as a burden rather than a privilege, and even in the days of
King John the barons only desired it as a protection from
the imposition of some exceptional tax. The bishops and
barons were then the natural leaders of the people; they
alone were educated and armed, and they alone could
attempt any successful resistance to the exorbitant demands
of the Crown. They paid nearly all the taxes, and provided
money for the prosecution of every war. Upon them the
commonalty was dependent, looking to them for assistance
when the sovereign became too grasping or tyrannical. It
was the barons who forced King John to sign Magna Charta,
and to them, therefore, we are indebted for the laws and
constitution which we now possess. "They did not confine
it to themselves alone," as Chatham declared in the House
of Lords, on January 9, 1770, "but delivered it as a
common blessing to the whole people." But though the
present House of Lords has been described as composed of
descendants of the men who wrung the Charter from King
John on the plains of Runnymede, not more than four of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
existing peerages are, as a matter of fact, as old as Magna
Charta.</p>

<p>The feudal barons by tenure, whose right to a Parliamentary
summons gradually became hereditary as going
with their lands, were gradually joined by other prominent
men who, though not landowners, were summoned to give
the Council the benefit of their experience and advice.
Thus gradually evolved the modern system of hereditary
legislators, and the House of Lords developed into an
assembly such as we now know it, though numerically far
smaller.</p>

<p>In Richard II.'s reign the <i>Curia Regis</i> separated from
Parliament and became a Privy Council. The Lords were
then as unwilling as the Commons to attend diligently to
their Parliamentary duties, and it was only the subsequent
creation of dukes, marquesses, and viscounts that stimulated
the desire to sit and claim a writ of summons as a right.</p>

<p>The number of earls and barons summoned to Parliament
in the reigns of the first three Edwards varied from fifty to
seventy-five. At times, owing to the absence of the fighting
men of the country who were engaged in foreign warfare, it
fell as low as sixteen. In the first Parliament of Henry VIII.
there were less than thirty temporal peers, but in Elizabeth's
time this number had doubled. Since Stuart days the Lords
have become more and more numerous. James I. granted
peerages right and left to his favourites, and, by selling
baronies, viscountcies, and earldoms for sums ranging from
£10,000 to £20,000, enriched his coffers and added some fifty
members to the Upper House. The eighty-two temporal
peers who sat in his first Parliament were gradually reinforced
by his successors, until, in the time of George III.,
they numbered two hundred and twenty-four, exclusive of
their ecclesiastical brethren.</p>

<p>The Lords spiritual have not always sat in the House of
Lords. In early days the abbots and priors largely predominated
in that assembly, but with the abolition of the
monasteries they were banished from it, though a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
number retained their seats in right of the baronies which
they possessed.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Bishops were excluded from the House of
Lords by Act of Parliament in 1640&mdash;Cromwell omitted to
summon them to his Upper House in 1657&mdash;and were not
finally readmitted until 1661. Within living memory several
unsuccessful attempts have been made to keep them out of
Parliament. In 1836 a member of the Commons moved that
spiritual peers be released from attendance, but his motion
was defeated. Another member in the following year suggested
their exclusion on the ground that they had plenty to
occupy them elsewhere, that their contributions to debate
upon most legislative subjects were not particularly edifying,
and that they always voted with the Minister to whom they
were indebted for preferment. This motion met a fate
similar to that of its predecessor, as did another of the same
kind in 1870.</p>

<p>To-day some twenty-six spiritual peers, including the
two Archbishops of Canterbury and York, are given seats
in the House of Lords, where they help to swell the number
of that ever-increasing assembly.</p>

<p>Bishops usually confine themselves exclusively in the
House of Lords to the discussion of matters which concern
the spiritual welfare of the nation. Their contributions to
debates are generally "edifying," and when they happen to
cross swords with their lay brethren they are well able to
hold their own. Bishop Atterbury, of Rochester, once said
of a Bill before the House that he had often prophesied that
such a measure would be brought up, and was sorry to find
himself a true prophet. Lord Coningsby retorted that the
Right Reverend Prelate had put himself forward as a
prophet, but he would only liken him to a Balaam, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
reproved by his own ass. The Bishop at once replied that
he was well content to be compared to Balaam. "But, my
Lords," he added, "I am at a loss to make out the other part
of the parallel. I am sure that I have been reproved by
nobody but his Lordship!"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>With the creation of new peerages by successive monarchs
the list of temporal peers lengthened year by year. The
Union of the three kingdoms still further added to their
number. By the Acts of Union with Scotland and Ireland
it was laid down that sixteen Scottish and twenty-eight Irish
representative peers should sit in the House of Lords. These
were to be elected by their fellow-peers, the former for each
Parliament, the latter for life.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> They may be distinguished
in other particulars as well, for though a Scottish peer can at
any time resign his seat, an Irish peer can never do so. Even
though he be a lunatic, or otherwise incapable of attending,
he still retains his place in the legislature. He is also
privileged in other ways. In 1699 the Commons resolved
that no peer could give his vote at the election of a Member
of Parliament, and, three years later, that he could not
interfere in elections. To-day a standing order of the House
of Commons imposes the same restraint upon all but Irish
peers, who are exempt from these restrictions.</p>

<p>In 1875 the House of Lords was strengthened judicially
by the introduction of four Lords of Appeal. The House, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
is well known, has judicial as well as legislative functions to
perform. It has always been the Supreme Court of the
realm, and, ever since the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the
ultimate Appeal has lain to it in all cases except those
arising in Ecclesiastical Courts. Moreover, as the High
Court of Parliament, in conjunction with the Commons, it is
empowered to try offenders against the State whom the
Commons have impeached. It also enjoys the privilege of
trying any of its own members who may be charged with
treason or felony, and of determining any disputed claims of
peerage which may arise.</p>

<p>There have always been a sufficient number of Lords
learned in the law to provide a court for the trial of legal
cases. In the past, however, occasions have arisen when
the presence of lay peers has threatened to replace the
judicial aspect of the House by a political one which would
be fatal to its reputation as a court of appeal. It was not,
indeed, until 1845 that lords unlearned in the law began to
consider their presence during the hearing of judicial causes
to be not only unnecessary but undesirable, and discontinued
their attendance. Thirty years later the institution of four
life peerages, conferred upon eminent lawyers, added still
further weight to the legal decisions of the House. The
hearing of appeals is now left entirely to what are called the
Law Lords, who consist of the Lord Chancellor, a number of
peers who have held certain high judicial offices, and the four
Lords of Appeal in Ordinary&mdash;three of whom must, by the
Appellate Jurisdiction Act of 1876, be present on all appeal
cases.</p>

<p>The granting of life peerages, conferring rights of
summons to the House of Lords, save as above stated, has
been adjudged to be beyond the powers of the Crown. It
may truly be said that in the first days of Parliament the
House of Lords consisted almost entirely of life members.
But when the Government of Queen Victoria attempted to
revive a practice that had lain in abeyance for some centuries
they were not allowed to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>The Supreme Court of Appeal had been violently attacked
in the Commons, where certain members declared it to be
inferior to any tribunal in the land. Palmerston in 1856
determined to remedy its defects by the addition of two Law
Lords who should be life peers. This scheme was upheld by
the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cranworth, but met with determined
opposition in the Upper House. The Law Lords were
especially opposed to it, fearing that, if such a precedent were
allowed, no lawyer in the future would ever be given an
hereditary peerage. On the Premier's recommendation the
Queen proposed to confer life peerages upon two distinguished
lawyers, Parke and Pemberton Leigh, and proceeded
to issue a patent to the former, creating him Baron Wensleydale
for life. When, however, the matter was referred to the
Committee for Privileges, they decided that no life peer
could either sit or vote in the House of Lords, and the
Wensleydale and Kingsdown peerages had consequently to
be made hereditary.</p>

<p>Persons who are raised to the peerage to-day are made
peers of the United Kingdom. No Scotch peer has been
created since the Union in 1707, and the right of conferring
an Irish peerage which existed under certain restrictions in
the Act of Union has ceased to be exercised except upon one
notable recent occasion.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>During the last fifty years some one hundred and fifty
additions have been made to the membership of the House
of Lords. The only limit to the numerical increase of peers
would seem to lie in the good sense of the Prime Minister or
the patience of the Sovereign. It is of course the latter who
confers peerages, though as the former usually brings suitable
candidates for ennoblement to the royal notice, he is generally
held responsible for the result of his recommendations.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

FROM AN ENGRAVING BY JOHN FINE</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The House of Lords now includes some 616 members,
divided, as we have seen, into four classes; the Lords
Spiritual, the Lords Temporal&mdash;Princes of the Blood, Dukes,
Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Barons&mdash;the Representative
Peers of Scotland and Ireland, and the Lords of Appeal in
Ordinary.</p>

<p>The writ of summons, which did not cease to be regarded
as a burden until the reign of Edward II., is now looked upon
as a privilege and right which few peers would willingly forego.
And the question of mutual precedence which was never
mooted until the creation of Viscounts in Henry VI.'s time,
is now a matter of the utmost importance to the occupants of
the Gilded Chamber.</p>

<p>The first Parliament that is recognized as conferring
the right of peerage was that of the eleventh year of
Edward I. The Lords decided, in the recent case of Lord
Stourton claiming the Barony of Mowbray, that a writ
summoning a peer to this Parliament, followed by a sitting,
gave his descendants a seat in the House.</p>

<p>All Peers of the Realm&mdash;a phrase which came into use in
1322&mdash;are entitled to seats in the House of Lords once they
have attained their majority. Infancy disqualifies a peer
from receiving a writ of summons; failure to take the oath
or to affirm deprives him of the right of sitting. No alien
may sit in the Lords, nor may a bankrupt or a felon, and the
House as a Court of Justice may at any time pass sentence
disqualifying a peer from sitting.</p>

<p>The functions of the Upper House which have been the
subject of so much recent controversy and are still engrossing
the attention of Parliament and the public, have been in former
times variously defined by friendly or adverse critics. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Lords have been described as the brake on the parliamentary
wheel or as the clog in the parliamentary machine. Horace
Walpole wrote some bitter verses on the subject of that
House whose members "sleep in monumental state, to show
the spot where their great Fathers sate;"</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Thou senseless Hall, whose injudicious space,</span>
<span class="i0">Like Death, confounds a various mismatched race,</span>
<span class="i0">Where Kings and clowns, th' ambitious and the mean,</span>
<span class="i0">Compose th' inactive soporific scene."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Peers themselves no doubt regard the Upper Chamber
as a haven where merit may receive its ultimate reward;
where the achievements and the recompense of the deserving
are suitably immortalized. As a "compact bulwark against
the temporary violence of popular passion," to use Disraeli's
phrase, and as a council for weighing the resolutions of the
Commons who may at times be led away by public clamour
or a sudden impulse, the Second Chamber is regarded by
its defenders as of the greatest constitutional value. Lord
Salisbury once declared that the chief duty of the House of
Lords was to represent the permanent as opposed to the
passing feelings of the English nation; "to interpose a salutary
obstacle to rash or inconsiderate legislation; and to protect
the people from the consequences of their own imprudence."
Moreover, the Upper House thus has an opportunity of
improving the details of measures, many of which leave the
House of Commons in an unworkable shape, owing to the
conditions under which they are amended and passed through
it, and, but for the alterations effected by the Lords, would
remain unworkable when they came to be embodied in the
Statute-book.</p>

<p>It has never been the course of the Upper House to resist
a continued and deliberately expressed public opinion. The
Lords, as Lord Derby affirmed in 1846, "always have bowed
and always will bow, to the expression of such opinion."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
But although history to a certain extent bears out this
statement, on more than one occasion the hand of popular
clamour has battered at their doors for a long time before
wringing from them a reluctant acquiescence. There can be
no doubt that if the country were to express itself definitely
upon any question at a General Election, no House of Lords
would be strong enough (or weak enough) to attempt to
thwart the public will. But there have been numerous
instances in which the peers have endeavoured without
success to do so. In vain did they delay Parliamentary
Reform in 1831, when Sidney Smith likened the House of
Lords to Mrs. Partington, the old lady of Sidmouth who,
during the great storm of 1824, tried to push away the
Atlantic with her mop.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In vain did they inveigh against
the passing of the Jewish Oaths Bill or the Bill for the
abolition of the Corn Laws. They were eventually compelled
to pass the latter, not because they thought it a good Bill,
but because, as the Duke of Wellington said, it had passed
the House of Commons by a huge majority, and "the Queen's
Government must be supported."</p>

<p>On the other side it may be said that they have
occasionally interpreted more successfully than the Lower
House the views of the electorate, and of this perhaps the
rejection of the Home Rule Bill of 1893 is the most
prominent example.</p>

<p>Even without actually rejecting Bills the Lords have
frequently opposed the will of the Commons by returning
the Bills sent up to them in so amended and altered a shape
as to prove wholly unacceptable; and an appeal to the country
upon every point of difference, or even upon every Bill wholly
rejected, is of course impracticable.</p>

<p>In some such cases the Commons have had recourse to
a method of coercing the Lords, known by the name of
"tacking," which depends for its efficacy upon the acceptation
of certain doctrines relating to Money Bills laid down by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Commons at intervals during the last three centuries, and in
the main acquiesced in by the Lords.</p>

<p>The history of the matter, though of acute interest at the
present time, is too long to go into here. It will be sufficient
to mention that in 1678, as the result of a violent struggle
between the two Houses, the Commons passed Resolutions
asserting (not for the first time) that all Money Bills must
have their origin in the Lower House, and that the Hereditary
Chamber is powerless to amend them. And though the
Lords at the time protested against both these conclusions,
by their action through a long course of years they must be
taken to have acquiesced in them. If, then, the Lords were
unable to amend a Money Bill, they might be compelled to
accept an obnoxious measure of a different nature if it were
included in such a Bill, the whole of which they would be
loth to throw out. This was the process adopted in several
instances by the Commons, against which the Lords passed,
in 1702, a Standing Order declaring the "annexing any
foreign matter" to be "unparliamentary and tending to the
destruction of the Constitution."</p>

<p>In 1770 the Commons brought in a Bill to annul the
royal grants of forfeited property, and, knowing that it
would be objectionable to the Upper House, cunningly
tacked it on to a Money Bill. The Lords returned it, with
the foreign matter excised; but it was sent back to them
once more, and, acting on the advice of the Duke of
Marlborough who counselled concession, they eventually
swallowed the whole mixture as gracefully as they could
find it in their hearts to do. In 1860, the two Houses came
into collision again on the same subject, when the Lords
threw out the Bill abolishing the duty on paper, which was
a financial question. Gladstone retorted in the following
year by tacking this Bill on to the Budget, and in this shape
the Lords passed it. But their right of rejection&mdash;which
indeed is involved in the necessity for their assent to every
Bill&mdash;was never questioned, either in 1678 or since, until the
Budget Bill was thrown out in December, 1909, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
whole question of the relations between the two Houses
was brought into vital prominence and made the subject of
an agitation not easily to be assuaged.</p>

<p>There has always existed a spirit of antagonism between
the two Houses. Gladstone declared that the Commons were
eyed by the Lords "as Lancelot was eyed by Modred," and this
mutual antipathy has occasionally expressed itself in overt
acts of rudeness. During a debate in the Lords in 1770, on
the defenceless state of the nation, a peer moved that the
House be cleared of strangers. A number of the Commons
happened to be standing at the Bar, but, notwithstanding
their protests, they were unceremoniously hustled out, being
followed by a volley of hisses and jeers as they left the
Chamber. The Duke of Richmond and many other peers
were so disgusted at this exhibition of ill-feeling that they
walked out of the House. Colonel Barré has left a graphic
description of the scene. The Lords, he says, developed all
the passions and violence of a mob. "One of the heads of
this mob&mdash;for there were two&mdash;was a Scotchman. I heard
him call out several times, 'Clear the Hoose! Clear the
Hoose!' The face of the other was scarcely human; for he
had contrived to put on a nose of enormous size, that disfigured
him completely, and his eyes started out of his head
in so frightful a way that he seemed to be undergoing the
operation of being strangled."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Two years after this scene, in 1772, Burke was kept
waiting for three hours with a Bill which he was carrying from
the Commons to the Lords. When he subsequently reported
his ill-treatment to the Lower House, their indignation knew
no bounds, and they proceeded to revenge themselves in a
somewhat puerile manner. The very next Bill that the
House of Lords sent down to them was rejected unanimously,
and the Speaker threw the offensive measure on to the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the House, whence it was kicked to the door by a number
of indignant members.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand the cause of jealousy and
anger between the Houses, in spite of the fact that so many
of the Lords have at one time or another been members of
the Commons, and so many of the Commons hope to end
their days in the Lords. (Croker, in a letter to Lord
Hatherton, recalls a visit he paid as a stranger to the
Upper House in 1857, where, of the thirty peers present,
there was not one but had sat with him in the Commons,
including the Duke of Wellington and the Lord Chancellor.
"It shows," he says, "how completely the House of Commons
has been the nursery of the House of Lords."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>) The resentment
against the Lords that undoubtedly exists in the bosoms
of the Commons, which is not confined to one side of the
House, but seems to be universal, results from the power of
rejection which the peers can at any time exercise with regard
to a measure, or of making amendments by which they can
alter it out of all recognition, thus nullifying in a single day
the labours of months in the Lower House. And when it
is considered that this ruinous result is due not only to men
who owe their seats to their successful exertions in various
professions, but also in larger proportion to those who owe
them to being, as Lord Thurlow said of the Duke of Grafton,
"the accident of an accident,"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the situation must to many
minds appear wholly intolerable.</p>

<p>One very clear cause of failure in the House of Lords to
give satisfaction lies in the fact that, although government
by Party is the very groundwork of the parliamentary
constitution, as far as the Upper House is concerned such
an idea might just as well not exist at all. Whatever the
political complexion of the party in power in the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Commons, the Lords maintain an invariable Conservative
majority, indifferent to the swing of any popular pendulum,
and as fixed and unalterable as the sun. But at no time for
the last century has the inequality been so marked as at
present, when it may be truthfully said that the Liberal
peers would scarcely fill a dozen "hackney coaches."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And
though the Liberal party has created a considerable number
of peers during the last few years, it has never recovered from
the secession of Liberal Unionists, and it would take many
years of Liberal supremacy and large drafts upon the Prerogative
of the Crown to restore even the comparative
balance of early Victorian days.</p>

<p>This may or may not be an advantage, for though the
staunch Tory is tempted to exclaim in the words of Disraeli:
"Thank God there is a House of Lords!" the equally staunch
Radical is scarcely likely to consider the existence of this perpetually
antagonistic majority a sufficient cause for gratitude
towards the Almighty. The difficulty of equalising the parties
seems insurmountable, so long as ennoblement is an expensive
luxury and Peers continue to be drawn from the wealthy
classes.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> There is, too, something essentially Conservative
about the atmosphere of the House of Lords, which sooner
or later impregnates the blood of its inmates; under its
influence the Liberal of one generation rapidly exhibits a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
tendency to develop into the Conservative of the next. But
this charge is no doubt one which may be brought with more
or less truth against any Second Chamber, however constituted,
which is composed of men of a certain age and position,
not immediately responsible to the fluctuating voices of the
people. Whether one considers such stability to be a merit
or the reverse depends upon whether one adopts Lord
Palmerston's and Lord Salisbury's views of the functions
of a Senate, or regards it merely as a useful and select body
of legislators enjoying certain limited powers of criticism and
delay.</p>

<p>So much has been written about this great modern controversy,
that it is unnecessary to increase the literature
which exists upon both sides. The issue seems to lie between
reducing the Second Chamber to comparative impotence
or attempting by judicious reforms in its composition to
bring it into greater sympathy with the First Chamber.</p>

<p>The Resolutions recently passed by the Commons,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
for their object the complete annihilation of the latter in all
matters of finance, and the retention for them of such
modified powers of influencing other legislation as would
enable them to delay Bills during the early years of a
shortened Parliament, and refer them to the country during
its last two years. The question of "tacking," in Money
Bills, is to be referred to the sole arbitrament of the
Speaker; but this becomes of trifling importance when it is
argued that almost any revolutionary change could be
effected within the corners of a legitimate financial measure.
The objection taken to the overriding of the Veto in the
case of a Bill thrice presented, is that it amounts to one-Chamber
legislation and would result in two classes of Acts&mdash;one
passed by the Commons alone, and the other by both
Houses.</p>

<p>The policy of Reform, on the other hand, is unacceptable
to those who desire the predominance of the First Chamber,
as any successful scheme for removing present defects in the
constitution of the Lords&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> the excessive size of the House,
the preponderance therein of one party, and the presence
of undesirable members&mdash;must result in its increased strength
and importance. Consequently the Commons have neither
made nor encouraged any attempts in that direction.</p>

<p>Such suggestions as have taken any shape have been
proposed by the Lords themselves, and the history of the
last thirty years exhibits many internal efforts to reform
on the part of those dissatisfied with the ancient constitution
of the House. In 1884, Lord Rosebery's motion for a Select
Committee to consider the best means of promoting the
efficiency of the House of Lords, was negatived. Four years
later he moved for another Select Committee to inquire
into the Constitution of the House. In the same year an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
elaborate Bill of Lord Dunraven's for reforming the Lords
was rejected, and another, promoted by Lord Salisbury, was
withdrawn after having passed the second reading. In 1908
a committee met, under the chairmanship of Lord Rosebery,
to look into the whole question, and issued a most interesting
and practical report, full of admirable recommendations. This
committee began by pointing out the expediency of reducing
the numbers of an assembly which, within recent years has
increased to such an extent as to render itself too unwieldy
for legislative purposes. It strongly urged that the recommendations
to the Crown for the creation of hereditary
peerages should be restricted within somewhat narrower
limits. Many peers, as the report explained, are obviously
ill-suited to their Parliamentary duties; others find the
work irksome and distasteful; of a few it may euphemistically
be observed that their release from the burden
of legislative responsibilities would be eminently desirable.
Lord Rosebery's committee therefore came to the conclusion
that the dignity of a peer and the dignity of a Lord of
Parliament should be separate and distinct, and that,
except in the case of peers of the Blood Royal, the
possession of a peerage should not necessarily be attended
with the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords.
A further suggestion was made that the hereditary peers
should be represented by two hundred of their number,
elected by them to sit as Lords of Parliament, not for life,
but for each parliament, and that the number of Spiritual
Peers should be proportionately reduced to ten. The
inclusion of representatives from the Colonies, and the
granting of a writ of summons to a number of qualified
persons who had held high office in the State, figured
prominently in this scheme of reform.</p>

<p>Following up these recommendations, the House on the
motion of Lord Rosebery has recently adopted the following
resolutions for its own reconstitution:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">"(1) That a strong and efficient Second Chamber is not
merely an integral part of the British Constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
but is necessary to the well-being of the State and
to the balance of Parliament.</p>

<p class="hanging">"(2) That such a Chamber can best be obtained by the
reform and reconstitution of the House of Lords.</p>

<p class="hanging">"(3) That a necessary preliminary of such reform and
reconstitution is the acceptance of the principle
that the possession of a peerage should no longer
of itself give the right to sit and vote in the House
of Lords."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We are sometimes tempted nowadays to laugh, like "the
gardener Adam and his wife," at the claims of long descent.
But the pride of birth and blood is common to all nations,
perhaps less so in England than elsewhere. The French ducal
family of Levis boasted a descent from the princes of Judah,
and would produce an old painting in which one of their
ancestors was represented as bowing, hat in hand, to the
Virgin, who was saying, "Couvrez-vous, mon cousin!"
Similarly the family of Cory possessed a picture of Noah
with one foot in the ark, exclaiming, "Sauvez les papiers de
la maison de Cory!"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Byron is said to have been prouder
of his pedigree than of his poems, and it is to be hoped that
our aristocracy will never entirely forget that their ancestors
have handed down to them traditions which are more precious
than the titles and lands by which they are represented.</p>

<p>One cannot altogether relish the sight of several peers,
who had been considered incompetent to manage their own
affairs, hastening to Westminster at the call of a party
"Whip" to record their votes upon Imperial concerns of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
greatest importance. And though it must be admitted that
it is rare indeed for the incompetent or degenerate members
of the Upper House to take any part in its deliberations, the
fact that they have the undoubted right to do so scarcely
tends to enhance the respect in which that assembly is
popularly held. In spite, however, of the occasional presence
of "undesirables," it is generally acknowledged that if any
question arises requiring a display of more than ordinary
knowledge of history, or more practical wisdom or learning,
these can nowhere be found so well as in the Upper
House. There, too, the level of oratory and of common
sense is perceptibly higher than in the popular assembly.
But the Reform Bill of 1832 enabled the Commons to speak
in the name of the people, which they had never hitherto
done, and which the Lords cannot do, and thus created that
wide gulf which now separates them from the House of
Lords. Here, however, as well as there, are many men who
realise that, in the words of Lord Rosebery, they have a
great heritage, "their own honour, and the honour of their
ancestors, and of their posterity, to guard."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE HOUSE OF COMMONS</h3>


<p>The Witenagemot, as we have already seen, was
essentially an aristocratic assembly. The populace
sometimes attended its meetings, but, beyond expressing
their feelings by shouts of approval, took no part in
its deliberations. For many years after the Conquest the
People continued to be unrepresented in the Great Council
of the nation, though they were still present as spectators.
From 1066 until about 1225, says Blackstone, the Lords were
the only legislators. After the latter date the Commons
were occasionally summoned, and in 1265 they formed a
regular part of the legislature. Then for the first time did
the counties of England return two knights, and the boroughs
and cities two deputies each, to represent them in Parliament.
Seventy-four knights from all the English counties except
Chester, Durham, and Monmouth,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and about two hundred
burgesses and citizens, sat in the Parliament of Edward I.;
but it was not until the reign of his successor that any
attempt was made to form a constitutional government.</p>

<p>The Three Estates in those days sat in the same Chamber,
but did not join in debate. The Lords made the laws, and
the Commons looked on or perhaps assented respectfully.
The separation of the two Houses took place in the reign of
Edward III., when the knights threw in their allegiance with
the burgesses, and in 1322 the Lower House<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> first met apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p><p>The power of the Commons increased gradually as time
advanced. By the end of the thirteenth century they had
secured sufficient authority to ensure that no tax could be
imposed without their consent. By the middle of the fourteenth
no law could be passed unless they approved. But
many centuries were yet to elapse before the chief government
of the country passed into their hands.</p>

<p>The expense of sending representatives to Parliament
was long considered a burden, many counties and boroughs
applying to be discharged from the exercise of so costly a
privilege. The electors of those days were apparently less
anxious to furnish a Member for the popular assembly than
to save the payment of his salary. Indeed, the city of
Rochester, in 1411, practised the frugal custom of compelling
any stranger who settled within its gates to serve a term in
Parliament at his own expense. He was thus permitted to
earn his freedom, and the parsimonious citizens saved an
annual expenditure of about £9.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>With the gradual growth of parliamentary power the
importance of electing members to the House of Commons
began to be recognized, and, during the Wars of the Roses,
fewer and fewer applications were made by boroughs and
cities anxious to be relieved of this duty.</p>

<p>Until Henry VI.'s time, when the modern system of Bills
and Statutes began to come into being, legislation was by
Petition. The control of Parliament was still very largely
in the hands of the Crown, and successive sovereigns took
care that their influence over the Commons should be
maintained. With this object in view Edward VI. enfranchised
some two-and-twenty rotten boroughs, Mary added
fourteen more, and in Elizabeth's time sixty-two further
members, all under the royal control, were sent to leaven
the Commons.</p>

<p>The attendance in the Lower House was still poor, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
more than two hundred members ever taking part in the
largest divisions, and it was only at the culmination of the
conflicts between Parliament and the Stuart Kings that
the Commons began to display a real desire for independent
power.</p>

<p>If the Revolution of 1688 firmly and finally established
the supremacy of Parliament, it was only a supremacy over
the Crown. The democratic element to which we are
accustomed in a modern House of Commons was still conspicuously
lacking. Both Houses remained purely aristocratic
in character until long after this. Whigs and Tories
might wrangle over political differences; they were at one
in their determination to uphold the interests of a single
privileged class. "This House is not the representative of
the people of Great Britain," said Pitt in the Commons in
1783; "it is the representative of nominal boroughs, of
ruined and exterminated towns, of noble families, of wealthy
individuals, of foreign potentates." Eight members of Parliament
were then nominated by the Nabob of Arcot, and in
1793 the Duke of Norfolk's nominees in the House numbered
eleven. The Crown, the Church, and the aristocracy governed
the country. The Commons were an insignificant body,
open to bribery, dependent upon rich patrons or upon electors
whose corruption was notorious. Prior to 1832, only 170
out of some 658 members of Parliament were independent;
the remainder were nominated by wealthy individuals. The
Reform Bill of 1832, however, brought about a mighty
change for the better. The electorate of the country was
raised from 300,000 to 1,370,000. Fifty-six corrupt boroughs
were disfranchised, thirty-one were deprived of one member
each, and two others were reduced; and the hitherto inadequate
representation of other towns and boroughs was
rectified.</p>

<p>The Reformed Parliament that met in the following year
differed in many respects from its predecessors. Sir Robert
Peel was much struck by the alteration in tone, character,
and appearance of the new House of Commons. "There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was an asperity, a rudeness, a vulgar assumption of independence,
combined with a fawning reference to the
people out of doors, expressed by many of the new members,
which" (as he told his friend Raikes) "was highly disgusting."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The Duke of Wellington, who had gone to the
Peers' Gallery of the House of Commons to inspect the new
Parliament, expressed his opinion more tersely. "I never
saw so many shocking bad hats in my life!" he said. The
spirit of democracy had crept in, but it was still an unwelcome
visitor. For many years the aristocracy maintained a great
preponderance in the House of Commons&mdash;in 1868 that
assembly comprised 45 heirs of peerages, 65 younger sons
of peers, and 57 baronets<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>&mdash;but its power decreased year by
year, though even now it cannot be said to be wholly
extinct.</p>

<p>By the Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 the franchise
qualifications were once more extended, and three and a half
million names added to the register. With the election, in
1874, of the first Labour candidates&mdash;of whom one, at least,
was a genuine working-man&mdash;the Commons gradually began
to assume that representative appearance which it now
presents.</p>

<p>During the last three centuries the Lower House has
increased very considerably in size as well as in importance.
It numbered 300 in the reign of Henry VI., and 506 at the
time of the Long Parliament. In 1832, by which time the
Acts of Union had added 45 Scottish and 100 Irish
members,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the numbers had risen to 658, and to-day some
670 members sit in Parliament.</p>

<p>The House of Commons has long ago shaken off the
shackles of the Crown, and will perhaps some day be almost
as wholly emancipated from the influence of the aristocracy.
Its power is increasing yearly, owing mainly to the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it has gained the confidence of the country, and it is now
generally felt that when any great question arises, the House
will solve it, as Disraeli said some fifty years ago, "not
merely by the present thought and intelligence of its members,
but by the accumulated wisdom of the eminent men who
have preceded them."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>To appreciate the exact nature of those inducements
which tempt a man to enter Parliament must often prove
perplexing to the lay mind. To Charles James Fox the
pleasures of patronage seemed the circumstances which
chiefly rendered desirable the possession of political power.
But the patronage in the hands of a private member to-day
is of too insignificant a nature to prove an irresistible temptation,
and political power of an appreciable kind is reserved
for the very few.</p>

<p>The life of the modern legislator is a strenuous and an
expensive one; it cannot be successfully undertaken by a
poor or an idle man. Before a candidate may stand for
Parliament at all he must deposit a substantial sum with
the Returning Officer, and the mere expenses of election
vary from £350 to £900 in boroughs, and from £650 to as
much as £1800 in counties.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Add to this the annual sum&mdash;variously
computed at from £200 to £500&mdash;which a
member spends in subscriptions within his constituency, and
it can readily be imagined that the parliamentary life is not
open to all. There would, indeed, seem to be some justification
for the criticism of that cynical member who said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he had often heard the House of Commons called "the best
club in London," and supposed that it was so termed because
it demanded the largest entrance fee.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> A few fortunate
candidates have their election expenses paid by a party or
by Trades Unions, but these are in the minority, and the
comparatively large cost of entering Parliament is the chief
reason why, in spite of the democratic tendency of modern
political thought, the House of Commons still remains in
large measure a delegation of the richest if not perhaps of
the most aristocratic class in England. This state of things
is likely to continue unless some system is adopted of
remunerating the services of legislators in the fashion which
long prevailed in England and is still in vogue upon the
Continent. But it is certainly open to argument whether
its adoption would improve the quality of the House or
the respect entertained for it in the country.</p>

<p>In the Parliaments of Edward III. members received
regular payment, the wages varying from year to year. At
the beginning of the fourteenth century, for example, the
knights of Dorsetshire were paid 5<i>s.</i> a day; later on this was
reduced to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In 1314 the daily wage of county
members was 4<i>s.</i>, and they were also allowed a small sum to
cover travelling expenses. In Henry VIII.'s reign boroughs
were expected to pay their own members' expenses. Frugal
constituencies occasionally bargained with their would-be
representatives, and candidates, stimulated to generous impulses
by the idea of imminent election, would agree to
defray their own expenses or even to go without wages
altogether. Sometimes, too, members appear to have been
willing to pay for the privilege of election. In 1571 a certain
Thomas Long was returned for the Wiltshire borough of
Westbury by the simple process of paying the mayor a sum
of £4. Long's unfitness for a seat in Parliament&mdash;he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a simple yeoman&mdash;became apparent as soon as he entered
the House. On being questioned, he admitted having bribed
the constituency to elect him, and was at once informed that
the House had no further need of his services. The inhabitants
of Westbury were fined £20, and the Mayor was
compelled to refund his money.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The practice of paying members long continued. In the
year 1586 we find the member for Grantham suing the
borough for his salary. The House of Commons does
not, however, appear to have been anxious to uphold this
claim, and requested that it should be withdrawn. By this
time, indeed, it had become usual for members to forego the
financial advantages of election&mdash;though there still remained
some notable exceptions who were not satisfied with the
honorary rewards attaching to the possession of a seat in
Parliament&mdash;and in 1677 the Commons repealed the Statute
by which wages were paid to members.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Samuel Pepys deplored the gradual neglect of the old
practice requiring constituencies to allow wages to their
representatives, whereby, he said, "they chose men that
understood their business and would attend it, and they
could expect an account from, which now they cannot."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
But this view was not the popular one, and electors gladly
availed themselves of the change in public opinion to discontinue
the earlier system. Motions have been brought
forward on more than one occasion, "to restore the ancient
constitutional custom of payment of members,"&mdash;notably in
1870 and 1888&mdash;but have always been rejected by a large
majority.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Nowadays, however, there seems some inclination
to revert to the old-fashioned and more expensive
method, and within recent years a Liberal Prime Minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
has promised to provide payment for members whenever
funds for the purpose are available. In other respects the
desire of the member of Parliament today would appear
to be rather in the direction of relinquishing than of adding
to his personal privileges. In the eighteenth century, for
example, he would never have dreamt of paying postal fees.
Members transmitted their correspondence without charge
by the simple process of inscribing their names in one corner
of the envelope. The privilege of "franking," as this was
called, was afterwards limited by its being required that the
date and place of posting should be added in the member's
handwriting, and the daily number of free letters was restricted
to ten sent and fifteen received. In those free and
easy days kind-hearted members would provide their friends
with large bundles of franked half-sheets of paper, and the
number of persons who paid any postage on their correspondence
two hundred years ago must have been very small
indeed. In a letter written by Mrs. Delany to a friend in
1749 we find the subject mentioned in a way that shows how
universally available had become such opportunities for
defrauding the revenue. "I have been so silly as to forget
franks," she writes. "I must beg the favour of you to get
<i>a dozen or two</i> for me from Sir Charles Mordaunt.... I
don't know," she adds, "but you will find a few of the Duke
of Portland's in the drawer with the paper."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

FROM AN ENGRAVING BY JOHN PINE</span>
</div>

<p>By the end of the eighteenth century the improper franking
of letters threatened to become a public scandal. Covers
were transmitted by the hundred, packed in boxes, the only
limit to their distribution being the good nature of members.
A London banker once received thirty-three covers containing
garden seeds from a Scottish member, and it became apparent
to the postal authorities that some effort must be made to
put a stop to the practice.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This was eventually done in
1840, not without a struggle, and the modern member of
Parliament who writes letters to his friends must do so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
at his own expense. He is still, however, allowed to send
a certain number of printed copies of bills to his constituents,
free of charge, by writing his name in a corner of the packet.</p>

<p>To-day the privileges of membership are certainly not of
a material kind. A few men enter the House of Commons
for social purposes, and must be sadly disappointed in the
result. The simple letters, "M.P." on a card are indeed no
longer, as the author of that entertaining work, "Men and
Manners in Parliament," declared them to be thirty years
ago, "the surest passport to distinction for mediocrity travelling
on the continent."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Bitter experience has shattered the
simple faith in human nature which was once the chief charm
of the Swiss innkeeper. The sight of a British member of
Parliament signing a cheque no longer inspires him with
confidence. He is only too well aware that among those&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Types of the elements whose glorious strife</span>
<span class="i0">Form'd this free England, and still guard her life,"</span>
</div>

<p>there exist a few who are not above leaving their hotel bills
permanently unpaid; and this knowledge has endowed him
with a caution which is both galling to the sensitive soul of
the average M.P. and extremely inconvenient to the tourist
who has momentarily mislaid his letter of credit.</p>

<p>If the member cannot now enjoy the unmixed respect of
the foreigner, it is equally certain that at home he is no
longer looked upon with the veneration with which his predecessors
were commonly regarded. His constituents treat
him as their servant no less than as their representative.
And though he may find some comfort in that definition of
a member's duties for which Edmund Burke is responsible&mdash;which
perhaps cost that statesman his seat at the General
Election of 1780&mdash;this will prove but a slight consolation
when he is suddenly called upon by his local committee to
explain some change of views or to account for constant
neglect of his parliamentary duties.</p>

<p>Parliament is not, indeed, as Burke told the electors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Bristol, a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile
interests, which interests each must maintain, as an agent
and advocate, against other agents and advocates. It is a
deliberate assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of
the whole; where not local purposes, not local prejudices,
ought to guide, but the general good, resulting from the
general reason of the whole. "You choose a member
indeed," he said; "but when you have chosen him, he is not
a member of Bristol, but he is a member of <i>Parliament</i>."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
At the same time a member cannot afford to forget that he
owes much to his constituents; his existence in Parliament
depends very greatly upon their good pleasure. He must be
to a certain extent at their beck and call, willing to subscribe
to their local charities, to open their bazaars, visit their
hospitals, kick off at their football matches, take the chair at
their farmers' dinners or smoking-concerts. He must have
a welcome hand ever extended in the direction of the squire,
a smile for the licensed victualler, a kindly nod of the head
for the meanest elector, and (at election times) a kiss for the
humblest voter's stickiest child. When constituents call upon
him at the House he must greet them with a display of
effusiveness which gives no hint of his annoyance at being
interrupted in the middle of important business. They may
want to be shown round the House, and such a natural desire
on their part must be acquiesced in, though it is not every
one who has the courage to escort a band of six hundred
constituents round the Chamber, as did a member in 1883.
Every morning the postman will bring him&mdash;besides that
voluminous bundle of parliamentary papers and bluebooks,
with the contents of which he is mythically supposed to
make himself acquainted&mdash;a score of applications of various
kinds from his constituents, all of which must be attended to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
The day is long past when he can emulate the cavalier
methods of Fox who, as Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, affixed a notice to the door of his office: "No letters
received here on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays,
Fridays or Saturdays! and none answered on any day!"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The modern member's duties are by no means confined
to the House of Commons, nor are they limited to the
duration of the session. Formerly it would never have
occurred to a member to make a speech in his constituency,
once he was elected; though as a candidate he would of
course address the voters, and might even be compelled to
attend a banquet or a provincial dance.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The idea of paying
a visit to the electors of any constituency other than his own
would, a century ago, have been considered in the worst
possible taste. Nowadays, however, the point of view is
changed. No sooner has he completed his share in the
arduous work of the session&mdash;the long tedious hours of debate,
the wearisome attendance on committees, the continual
tramping through the division lobbies&mdash;and shaken the dust
of Westminster from his feet, than he must hasten to the
country to give some account of his stewardship, to dazzle
his constituents with the oratorical platitudes which have
failed to move the more fastidious audience of the House of
Commons. He must even be ready to rush off to the
assistance of a fellow-member in some distant shire, and
purge his bosom of the same perilous stuff upon various
platforms all over the country.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Coke declared three hundred years ago that
every member of Parliament should in three respects at least
resemble the elephant; "first, that he hath no gall; secondly,
that he is inflexible, and cannot bow; thirdly, that he is
of a most ripe and perfect memory."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> He might well have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
added some of the other qualities of that admirable beast&mdash;patience,
docility, the capacity for hard work, and, above all,
a thick skin. Though outwardly inflexible, a modern
member must be prepared to bow to the wishes of his party;
and in his ripe and perfect memory there should be room for
the names and faces of his constituents and their wives. He
must be patient when he has failed for the hundredth time to
"catch the Speaker's eye"; he must be docile when the
Whip urges him to vote in favour of a motion with which he
disagrees fundamentally; and if he be of a thin-skinned
disposition or of a delicate constitution, the labours of the
House of Commons may soon prove too much for him. If
he is unambitious and anxious to lead a peaceful life, he will do
well to remember the advice given by Ferguson of Pitfour,
who summed up his parliamentary experiences, in 1826, as
follows: "I was never present at any debate I could avoid,
or absent from any division I could get at. I have heard
many arguments which convinced my judgment, but never
one that influenced my vote. I never voted but once
according to my own opinion, and that was the worst vote I
ever gave. I found that the only way to be quiet in Parliament
was always to vote with the Ministry, and never to take
a place."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>No doubt the member of Parliament enjoys many
privileges which are denied to the mere layman. He is
stimulated by the excitement of participating in a perpetual
political conflict; he delights in the intellectual pleasure of
hearing the most interesting questions of the day debated by
the shrewdest men of the age; he is conscious of being in a
sense a public benefactor, with a direct (if somewhat slight)
influence upon the policy of his country. He is given a
front seat in what Mr. Biggar once called the "best theatre
in London," and there is always the chance that some day he
may himself be cast for a leading part in that great political
drama which is performed night after night on the boards of
the Theatre Royal, Westminster. Politics&mdash;"l'art de mentir à<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
propos," as Voltaire defined them&mdash;may have their origin
in the perversity rather than in the grandeur of the human
soul, but the attraction they exercise over the average Englishman
is very great.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But for the privileges of a parliamentary
career&mdash;one of the worthiest to which a patriot can devote
himself, in Mr. Balfour's opinion&mdash;a heavy price has to be
paid, and to the toll of toil and treasure levied by Parliament
must be added the sacrifice of independence as well as
of time.</p>

<p>In this twentieth century the initiative of the private
member has almost disappeared. The Government is alone
responsible for legislation; all the most important measures
brought in are Government measures. The time of the
House is placed, very early in each session, at the disposal
of the Government, its business is arranged to suit their
convenience, and the private member must be content to
make the most of such fragmentary opportunities as are
flung to him. He is controlled by his party and by his
Whip; he may not leave the House without permission; he
must vote at the word of command. At one moment he may
be called upon to speak at length upon a subject of which he
is sublimely ignorant, in order to allow his party a chance
of gathering their forces to meet an unexpected division;
at another he is compelled to refrain from good words,
though it may be pain and grief to him, in order to save the
precious time of the Government. And perhaps he will
occasionally be inclined to agree once more with Burke that
the same qualifications, nowadays, make a good member of
Parliament that formerly made a good monk: "Bene loqui
de superiore, legere breviarum taliter qualiter, et sinere res
vadere ut vadunt"&mdash;to speak well of the minister, read the
lesson he sets you, and let the State take care of itself!<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>Even so, the advantages of membership are not to be
despised; and once a man has tasted the sweets of political
life, all other professions fade into insignificance. He
may have been moved to enter Parliament by some ambitious
yearning after fame; he may have been prompted by
patriotic motives, or merely the desire to prove himself a
useful member of society, his serious opinion being (like that
of Buxton, the great opponent of Slavery) that "good
woodcock-shooting is a preferable thing to glory."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> His
contributions to debate may be of poor quality, but they will
not be altogether valueless, and, after an arduous day in the
House, he will listen with a glow of conscious rectitude to the
ancient and welcome cry of "Who goes Home?" which rings
through the lobbies and announces the close of the sitting.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Though he may never, perhaps, wake to find himself famous,
he will often sink comfortably to sleep on his return home
from the House in the early hours of the morning, soothed
by the consciousness of duty done. That in itself is a thing
not to be despised, and there may possibly be other benefits
in store for him. If he is sufficiently painstaking and
intelligent he may perchance have greatness thrust upon him
in the form of an under-secretaryship, and, when he has
scaled the outer breastworks of that Cabinet zareba to which
access is so difficult, the suspicion that he has long cherished
of being a heaven-born politician is at length confirmed.</p>

<p>Socrates was right when he said that whereas no man
undertook a trade that he had not thoroughly learnt, everybody
considered himself sufficiently qualified by nature to
undertake the trade of government, probably the most
difficult in the world. There are, however, certain disqualifications
which prevent the most ambitious man from serving
in Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p>Infants and minors may not be elected to the House of
Commons. But though they have always been excluded by
custom or statute, their presence was winked at until the end
of the eighteenth century. The members of those bygone
times seem generally to have been more youthful than the
members of to-day. Even the Chair was occupied by men
comparatively young, Seymour, Harley, and Sir Thomas
More each being elected Speaker before he had reached the
age of forty. The last-named speaks of himself as a "beardless
boy resisting greybeards and Kings themselves," referring
no doubt to the time when Cardinal Wolsey came to the
House of Commons in 1523, to ask for money for his royal
master, and he actively opposed the grant.</p>

<p>In Queen Elizabeth's time the Lower Chamber was not
weakened by the admission of too many infants; but during
the reign of James I. the ancient custom for old men to
make laws for young ones seems to have been inverted, there
being as many as forty members of Parliament who were
minors, and several who were not more than sixteen years
old.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The poet Waller sat in the Commons before he was
seventeen, while Lord Torrington (afterwards Duke of
Albemarle) took part in debate when he was only fourteen,
and at that age addressed the House in 1667, on the subject
of Clarendon's impeachment.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The infant members of that
day were singularly precocious and well able to look after
themselves. When, for instance, some one urged that Lord
Falkland was too young to sit in Parliament, as he had not
yet sown his wild oats, that young nobleman rudely replied
that he could imagine no more suitable place for sowing
them than the House of Commons, where there were so
many geese to pick them up.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The Crown saw no disadvantage in having youthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
legislators, who could all the more easily be influenced.
When Parliament assembled in 1661 and the tender age of
many of the members was pointed out to King Charles, he
answered that he found no great fault in that, "for he could
keep them till they got beards."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> By the Act of 1695,
however, infants were formally excluded from Parliament, but
for a long time they continued to sit in the House, though
they most probably abstained from voting.</p>

<p>Extreme youth was not considered a bar to parliamentary
success in days when it was possible for a politician to
become Prime Minister, as Pitt did, at the age of twenty-five,
though that statesman's father found it necessary on one
occasion to defend himself against the charge of immaturity.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Both Fox and Philip Stanhope (afterwards Lord Chesterfield)
delivered their maiden speeches a month or so before
they came of age,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and Lord John Russell was returned to
Parliament when he was still a minor.</p>

<p>As the years advanced the House of Commons became
more and more particular in this respect, and at the beginning
of the nineteenth century an eye-witness was struck by the
large proportion of bald-headed men&mdash;nearly a third of the
whole number&mdash;in the Lower Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> To-day no one who
has not reached the mature age of twenty-one can stand for
Parliament, much less sit upon the sacred green benches.</p>

<p>Lunatics and idiots are also disentitled to parliamentary
election. A member who goes mad after having taken his
seat can only be removed, however, if his case is proved to
be a hopeless one, the House being then petitioned to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the seat vacant, and the Speaker issuing a new writ. In one
well-known instance a committee of the House found that a
member's lunacy was not so incurable as to justify his
removal, and he retained his seat. In 1881 the case of a
lunatic recording his vote in a division was the occasion of
a painful and futile debate. The member in question suffered
from periodical bouts of insanity, and had recently been
certified "dangerous" at his own request, in order that he
might retire temporarily to an asylum. It was therefore
obviously improper for him to vote. The House, however,
declined to take any serious notice of the incident, the motion
for an inquiry by a Select Committee into the circumstances
of the case being negatived, and the matter tactfully allowed
to drop.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Aliens cannot sit in Parliament until they have taken the
precaution of becoming naturalised British subjects. In
William III.'s time all persons born outside the dominions
were disqualified, and when the Test and Corporation Acts
were repealed in George IV.'s reign, an amendment was
inserted by the Bishop of Llandaff in the House of Lords by
which Jews were excluded from Parliament. They were
finally admitted to the House of Commons in 1858, and
during the reign of Queen Victoria naturalisation was held to
carry with it full political rights.</p>

<p>English and Scottish peers are incapacitated from serving
in the Commons. Irish peers, however, may do so, provided
that they are not already sitting as representative peers in
the House of Lords.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The eldest sons of peers were excluded
from the Lower House down to the middle of the sixteenth
century, when they were gratefully admitted and given seats
of honour on the front bench with the Privy Councillors.</p>

<p>Irishmen enjoy parliamentary privileges not only as peers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
but also as bankrupts. The occasional combination of the
two therefore carries with it some slight compensation. A
bankrupt Englishman or Scotsman is disabled from even
standing as a candidate for Parliament, whereas his more
fortunate Irish brother may be elected. Members of Parliament
who become bankrupt after election may continue to
sit and vote in the Commons until the Speaker has received
official notification of their bankruptcy, or the House has
ordered their withdrawal.</p>

<p>The election of clergymen and other ministers was
prohibited by an Act of 1801, passed in order to deal with
the case of the Rev. J. Horne Tooke, the "Father of
Radicalism," who had been elected for Old Sarum. It did
not succeed in its object, however, for he continued to sit for
the remainder of the Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> And by another Act,
passed about 1870, any one who has relinquished the office
of priest or deacon is eligible for election. Otherwise no
minister of the Established Church may sit in Parliament.</p>

<p>Many other persons are similarly debarred, among whom
may be mentioned the holders of offices under the Crown
created since 1705, Crown pensioners (exclusive of civil
servants and diplomats), and Government contractors. Persons
guilty of treason or felony (who have neither served their
sentence nor been pardoned), or of corrupt practices at
elections are likewise disqualified,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> as are also those who are
unable to take the Oath of Allegiance or to affirm. There are,
besides, a number of officials connected with the administration
of justice, or concerned with the collection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Revenue, or representatives of the Crown&mdash;judges, colonial
governors, etc.&mdash;who are incapacitated by their positions from
sitting in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>At one period of parliamentary history lawyers were
excluded from the House of Commons, enactments in favour
of keeping out "gentlemen of the long robe" being passed
in Edward III.'s time. They were always unpopular
members, it being supposed that they only entered Parliament
as a stepping-stone to wider practice at the Bar or to
some sort of Government employment. The legal profession
was looked upon as one into which no one entered without
views of self-aggrandisement, and the use of a seat in
Parliament as a means of advertising oneself did not appeal
to the country at large.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Lawyers are allowed to sit in the
House to-day, but they may not practise as counsel before
Parliamentary Committees, nor even advise professionally
upon any private Bill.</p>

<p>Having successfully eluded all these disqualifications,
paid a large sum for the privilege of serving his country,
talked himself hoarse on the platforms of his constituency,
and finally been returned in triumph to the House of
Commons, the private member may consider himself safely
launched upon the parliamentary sea. It now remains to
be seen whether or not political life comes up to his expectations.
If he is energetic, ambitious, and eloquent he
will find free scope for his talents on the green benches at
Westminster. He will be given a chance of proving his
worth upon Select Committees. Here he can serve his
apprenticeship in preparation for that glorious day when he
may be inspired to thrill and enrapture a delighted assembly
with such an outburst of oratory as shall at once establish his
claim to the consideration of his party. Then indeed does
Fortune seem ready to smile upon the embryo statesman.
In imagination he sees himself lounging upon the Treasury
bench, his feet cocked up against the historic Table, while he
writes a report of the debate for the edification of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Sovereign. To the political enthusiast the prospect is a
rosy one. But alas! it is not every man who can aspire to
the giddy heights of the front bench. After many a session
of laborious days and sleepless nights, after many a recess
devoted to the tiresome art known as "nursing" his constituency,
after many disappointments and trials, our member
may still find himself at the bottom of the parliamentary
ladder. Even if he ascends to what Mr. Gladstone would
have called "measurable distance" of the top, his tenure is
precarious; in the defeat of a Government at a General
Election he too may fall. And though his constituents
remain loyal and his seat secure, there arrives a day when
he begins to weary of the slavery of parliamentary life, of
the drudgery of a political career. Like Macaulay, he may
at length come to define politics as a pursuit from which the
most that those who are engaged in it can expect is that by
relinquishing liberal studies and social pleasures, by passing
nights without sleep and summers without one glimpse of the
beauty of nature, they may attain "that laborious, that
invidious, that closely watched slavery which is mocked with
the name of power."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> When this tragic moment arrives,
or when through physical infirmity, advancing years, or
penury, he wishes to bid a long farewell to the scene of
his parliamentary labours, he has still a minor obstacle to
contend with.</p>

<p>A member cannot resign his seat, nor is it permissible for
him to exchange it for any other. Only his own death or
the dissolution of Parliament can enable him to cease from
being a member, unless the House itself declares his seat to
be vacant. Even expulsion from the House does not prevent
his immediate re-election by a constituency determined to
retain his services, as was shown in the case of Walpole&mdash;twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
expelled from the House, and re-elected by the voters
of Lynn&mdash;and of Wilkes and Bradlaugh. The only thing
that can prevent a man from sitting in the House, or allow a
member to escape from its service, is the fact of his coming
within the range of that long list of disqualifications already
enumerated.</p>

<p>How then can a member vacate his seat in the simplest
fashion? Many members would think twice before becoming
bankrupt or committing a felony in order to avoid parliamentary
duty. It is not given to every one to be a Colonial
Governor, an Auditor General, or even a Charity Commissioner.
But, by the merciful connivance of the powers
that be, it is always possible for a member to incapacitate
himself by holding a Crown appointment. For this beneficent
purpose two ancient stewardships of a purely nominal value
are upheld, that by accepting either of these offices a member
may be enabled to retire gracefully from Parliament.</p>

<p>The steward or bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of
Stoke, Desborough and Boneham, and the steward of Northstead,
were officers appointed by the Crown in past ages to
look after certain Buckinghamshire forests in which brigands
abounded. The brigands are long since dead, and the forests
themselves have been converted into parks and pasture lands,
but the stewardships remain, a convenient city of refuge for
members who desire to escape from the active strife of Parliament,
to whom they are sometimes presented as often as nine
times in one session. "The parliamentary constitution of
England," said Disraeli, "was born in the bosom of the
Chiltern Hills; as to this day our parliamentary career is
terminated among its Hundreds."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> And since no county
is fraught with greater historical and political interest than
Buckinghamshire, it is perhaps fitting that it should be
the means of providing a merciful release for the jaded
parliamentarian whose course is run.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER</h3>


<p>Parliament may be summoned to assemble wherever
the king pleases. Westminster, the site of that royal
palace which has sheltered so many English sovereigns,
from King Canute to Henry VIII., was for centuries the most
natural meeting-place for the Great Council of the nation.
But many another town, such as Winchester, Bury St.
Edmunds, Leicester, Coventry, Reading, Salisbury, and half
a dozen more, has at different times been selected as the
temporary seat of Parliament, either to suit the royal convenience,
or for other reasons.</p>

<p>Of the twenty Parliaments of Edward II. one met at Ripon,
one at Northampton, and three at York and Lincoln. In
Stuart days Oxford was the place chosen on two occasions,
in 1625 and in 1665, when London was being ravaged by the
Plague. Since the Revolution of 1668, however, Parliament
has ceased to be nomadic in its habits; in its old age it has
definitely settled down at Westminster, and there it is likely
to remain.</p>

<p>The palace in which Canute first resided, within a stone's
throw of the Thames, was burnt to the ground somewhere
about the year 1040. Edward the Confessor rebuilt it ten
years later, and in the days of William Rufus the addition of
the Great Hall further enhanced the dignity of the palace.
Here William held his first court, on his return from Normandy,
and since his day a succession of kings have made it
the centre of innumerable scenes of royal pomp and pageantry.</p>

<p>William Rufus was a man of large ideas. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
magnificence of the Great Hall did not entirely satisfy his taste
for grandeur. In his imagination he had conceived a still more
splendid scheme of architecture, and was disappointed with
the size of the new building. On first entering to inspect it,
accompanied by a large military retinue, he overheard some
tactless persons remark that, in their opinion, the Hall was
far too large. With a scornful look the King reduced these
critics to silence, explaining that, so far from this being the
case, the Hall was not half large enough, being, in fact, but a
bed-chamber in comparison with the building of which he
intended it to form part.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>By the end of the fourteenth century Westminster Hall
had fallen into disrepair, and during the reign of Richard II.,
when the poet Chaucer was clerk of the works, it was rebuilt,
the expense being met by a tax levied upon all foreigners
in the kingdom. Richard celebrated the event by keeping
Christmas there in a suitably seasonable fashion, "with daily
justings and runnings at tilt; whereunto resorted such a
number of people that there was every day spent twenty-eight
or twenty-six oxen, and three hundred sheep, besides fowl
without number."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Prior to the days when such feats of engineering as the
building of the modern Thames Embankment were possible,
the proximity of the Palace to the river necessitated a system
of constant repair. Until confined within reasonable limits,
the Thames showed a disposition to overflow its banks upon
the slightest provocation, much to the inconvenience of the
royal residents in the neighbourhood. In 1236 the Palace
was completely flooded, so that "men did row with wherries
in the midst of it," and six years later a similar fate befell
Westminster Hall. In 1579 the river once more trespassed
upon the royal domain, fish being afterwards found in a
moribund condition on the floor of the Great Hall. The
latter, indeed, continued to be visited by periodical floods as
late as the year 1841.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Fire, too, seems to have proved a constant menace to the
safety of the palace, though at the time of the Fire of London
the Great Hall was one of the few places in which citizens
could store their goods out of harm's way. In 1299 part of
the palace was burnt to the ground, and at the beginning of
the sixteenth century so great a proportion of it fell a prey
to a "vehement conflagration" that Henry VIII. decided
to forsake it altogether, and removed his court to Whitehall.
Since that day royal personages have ceased to lodge at
the Palace of Westminster, which is still, however, nominally
a royal residence, and as such remains in the custody of an
officer of the King's household.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

FROM AN ENGRAVING BY C. MOSLEY</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>The Great Hall still continued to be used as the most
appropriate stage for State ceremonies, for coronations and
the banquets with which such events were celebrated. It was
also the scene of most of the great State trials famous in
English history. Such men as William Wallace, the Earls of
Arundel, of Essex, and of Strafford, were here arraigned upon
a charge of high treason; here Charles I. was condemned to
death. In Westminster Hall Titus Oates was stripped of his
ecclesiastical habit and exposed to public obloquy, with a
placard upon his breast declaring his offence. Beneath this
wide oak roof the Duchess of Kingston was tried for bigamy,
much to her delight. Here, too, Warren Hastings faced his
accusers, and triumphed over them. This is the Hall, as
Macaulay says in a well-known passage, which witnessed the
just sentence of Bacon and the just absolution of Somers;
the Hall where the eloquence of the latter for a moment
awed and melted a victorious party inflamed with just resentment.
This, we may now add, is the Hall where the body of
Gladstone lay in state, and the mortal remains of King
Edward VII. received the homage of his sorrowing subjects.</p>

<p>No State trial has been held in Westminster Hall since
Lord Melville was acquitted there in 1806, and on the only
recent occasion on which a member of the House of Lords
was tried by his peers, on July 18, 1901, the Royal Gallery
of the Lords was fitted up as a court.</p>

<p>For centuries the coronation feasts, which were held in
Westminster Hall, provided the public with a stately and
imposing spectacle. Not the least interesting part of the
ceremony consisted in the entrance of the King's Champion,
clad in armour and mounted upon a fiery charger, who flung
down his gauntlet and challenged to mortal combat all who
dared to question the monarch's right to the throne. The
feat required some personal courage, as well as the possession
of a docile steed, for if it were not accomplished successfully
the effect might well be ludicrous. Before the coronation of
George III., Horace Walpole relates, Lord Talbot had spent
much care in training his charger to walk backwards, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
it might make a graceful exit from the Hall without ever
exposing its tail to the royal gaze. Unfortunately, the lesson
had been too well learnt, and the horse insisted upon entering
the Hall backwards, much to the amusement of the
spectators.</p>

<p>Sovereigns are no longer crowned in Westminster Hall,
but in the Abbey close by, and no coronation feast has been
held there since the accession of George IV., when the guests
repaid their sovereign's hospitality by carrying away most of
his spoons as souvenirs of the event. The Hall has, however,
been the scene of other less-important banquets, as, for
instance, in 1905, when the officers of the visiting French
fleet were entertained there as the guests of the British
nation.</p>

<p>To Westminster Hall, Henry II. summoned his Barons
in Council, and in the reign of Henry III. parliaments were
often held there. Gradually, however, the building became
devoted exclusively to the judicial side of the king's Great
Council, and, when Edward I. occupied the throne of England,
the Courts of King's Bench and Chancery held their meetings
regularly at the south end of the Hall. Peter the Great,
during a brief stay in England, paid a visit to Westminster
Hall, and was much struck by the presence of a number
of busy people in long black gowns and bobtailed wigs.
On being informed that these were lawyers, "I have but
two in my dominions," he observed thoughtfully, "and I
believe I shall hang one of those directly I get home!"</p>

<p>New buildings were erected in 1738, on the west side of
the Hall, to accommodate the judges, and when, about a
hundred and fifty years later, the Palace of Justice was built
in the Strand, the representatives of the law emigrated
thither in a body.</p>

<p>The general public for a long time shared with the lawyers
the privilege of trading within the precincts of Westminster
Hall. In Edward III.'s reign merchants' stalls abounded
there, being temporarily boarded over on the occasion of
State pageants, and, at a much later date, Laud tells us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
his diary, a conflagration in one of these shops threatened to
destroy the entire building.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century, book-sellers, law-stationers,
and other tradesmen still plied their callings in
the Hall, undisturbed by the pleadings of their legal rivals.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
On the one side, as we read in a contemporary chronicle,
were to be seen "Men with Baubles and Toys, and on the
other taken up with the Fear of Judgment, on which depends
their inevitable Destiny. On your Left Hand you hear a
nimble Tongu'd <i>Sempstress</i>, with her Charming Treble, Invite
you to buy some of her Knick-Knacks: And on your
Right, a Deep-mouth'd Cryar commanding Impossibilities,
viz. Silence to be kept among Women and Lawyers."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In
the days of Pepys, the Great Hall had become a regular
meeting-place for the public, and was still the most popular
market for the sale of books.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Trade has long been banished from the portals of Westminster
Hall, its stately precincts are now desecrated by no
foot less worthy than that of the Member of Parliament or
the Saturday sight-seer. In other respects the Hall remains
unchanged. Save for the retimbering of the roof in 1820
with oak taken from old men-of-war, it stands to-day
much as it has stood for centuries. Structural alterations
have occasionally been suggested, but without effect.
One projected by Lord Grenville, necessitating the removal
and raising of the entire roof, evoked many indignant
protests.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>In New Palace Yard, opposite the entrance of Westminster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Hall, a huge clock-tower once stood. It had been erected in
the reign of Edward I., the cost being defrayed by a
fine levied on Sir Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the
King's Bench, as a penalty for altering a judicial record in
favour of a pauper litigant. In this tower hung a bell, known
as "Great Tom of Westminster," whose voice on a clear
day could be beard as far away as Windsor.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In 1707
both tower and bell were pulled down, the latter being
recast and presented to St Paul's Cathedral where it still
hangs.</p>

<p>Near the tower was a fountain from which on great
occasions wine was made to flow for the delectation of the
populace, while close by stood the pillory in which Titus
Oates, John Williams, the publisher of John Wilkes's <i>North
Briton</i>, and many other offenders against parliamentary privilege,
suffered the penalty of their crimes.</p>

<p>Westminster Hall lies nearly due north and south. At
its south-east angle, stretching towards the river, stands St.
Stephen's Hall, on the site of that famous Chapel, founded
by King Stephen and called after his sainted namesake, which
was for so long the home of the Commons.</p>

<p>The Chapel was partly destroyed by fire in 1298, but
was subsequently restored at great cost by Edward III., who
also built an adjacent belfry of stone and timber containing
three huge bells which were rung at "coronations, triumphs,
funerals of princes, and their obits."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> After the Reformation
the thirteenth century decorations which originally adorned
the walls of St. Stephen's Chapel were whitewashed and
covered with boards, and the building was given over to
Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>Though the Three Estates originally sat together, they
seem to have deliberated separately. Parliament used to
meet occasionally in the Priory Church of Blackfriars
Monastery, but when the Houses parted company a chamber
in the Palace of Westminster was reserved for the Lords,
while the Commons retired to the Chapter House of the
Abbey. Later on they assembled in or near Westminster
Hall&mdash;Richard II. held a parliament in a building erected for
the purpose outside the Great Hall&mdash;and finally, about the
year 1550, St. Stephen's Chapel was fixed upon as the regular
meeting-place of the Commons.</p>

<p>The Chapel was an oblong building, but half as long and
half as broad as Westminster Hall, and most of the floor
space was occupied by the Lobby. It was a gloomy and
narrow chamber, and what the German traveller Moritz calls
"mean-looking." At the western end was a gallery to which
members ascended by means of a ladder near the southern
window.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> At the eastern end stood the Speaker's chair, and
opposite it the famous bar where so many persons have stood,
either as prisoners, witnesses, or patriots. Here Pepys, buoyed
up with brandy, appeared to answer the charges that had
been brought against the Navy Office in 1667-8. Here, a
century and a half later, Mrs. Clarke, the Duke of York's
discarded mistress, was examined for two hours on the subject
of his alleged corrupt sale of commissions&mdash;an ordeal from
which she emerged triumphantly. At this bar victorious
soldiers, from the days of Schomberg to those of Wellington,
have received the thanks of Parliament for the services they
rendered to their country. And many a trembling prisoner
has stood here to receive sentence or reprimand at the mouth
of the Speaker.</p>

<p>On either side of the old House were ranged rows of
wooden benches, hard and comfortless, with neither backs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
nor covering. Not even were Ministers provided with padded
seats.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"No satin covering decks th' unsightly boards;</span>
<span class="i0">No velvet cushion holds the youthful Lords;</span>
<span class="i0">And claim illustrious tails such small regard?</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! Tails too tender for a seat so hard!"<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span>
</div>

<p>St Stephen's Chapel was in size quite inadequate to the
needs of legislators&mdash;the only point, perhaps, in which it
resembled the present House of Commons. David Hume
complained perpetually of the lack of room; while Cobbett
cynically referred to it as "the little hole into which we are
all crammed to make the laws by which this great kingdom
is governed."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Lined with dark wainscot and lit by three
chandeliers, the gloomy chamber did not impress the stranger
with the dignity or splendour of parliaments, and a visitor
to St Stephen's might well have been excused for mistaking
the House of Commons for a den of thieves or a crew of
midnight conspirators.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>As was only natural, the dingy surroundings exercised a
detrimental influence upon the manners of members. Moritz
was surprised to see many of them lying stretched out at full
length on the uncomfortable benches fast asleep, while others
cracked nuts or ate oranges. "The many rude things the
members said to one another," he observes sadly, "struck
me much."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Not only was the House squalid and dirty, it
was also infested with rats. Speaker Manners Sutton told
Thomas Moore that the only time he had ever laughed while
occupying the Chair was during a debate in which members
of the Opposition had been squabbling fiercely together, when
he saw a large rat issue from beneath the front Opposition
bench and walk deliberately across to the Treasury side of
the House.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The Lobby of St Stephen's was, if possible, the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of even greater discomfort and squalor than was the House
itself. It was perpetually crowded, not only with members
and their servants, but also with the general public, and was
"as noisy as a Jews' synagogue." Pearson, for many years
head doorkeeper of the Commons, tells us that orange women
traded there regularly, selling their wares to thirsty politicians
during the sitting of the House. One old woman named
Drybutter was a great favourite among a certain class of
members, and knew more of their private affairs (we are
told) than "all the old bawds in Christendom put together."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
Another, Mullins by name, "a young, plump, crummy, rosy
looking wench, with clean white silk stockings, Turkey leather
shoes, pink silk <i>short</i> petticoat, to show her ancle to the
young bulls and old goats of the House," appealed especially
to the more amorous members.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>She was said to have killed more men with her eyes and
sighs than did many a general with his canister and grape-shot
in the American war. Oranges and biscuits were not, as
may be imagined, this fascinating creature's sole stock in trade.</p>

<p>In Stuart days the walls of St Stephen's Chapel were
temporarily brightened by the presence of the tapestry which
Charles II. hung there. This, however, was taken down
in 1706. About a hundred years later, when alterations
were being made to provide accommodation for the recently
added Irish members, the old thirteenth-century mural paintings
were discovered beneath the wainscot. No one, however,
seems to have realised their value, and they were carelessly
allowed to perish, sharing the fate that befell the curious old
tapestries which once adorned the walls of the famous Painted
Chamber.</p>

<p>This Painted Chamber, which lay between the two Houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of Parliament, was the original Council Chamber of the
Norman kings. Here parliaments were opened, and conferences
of both Houses held. Its walls were hung with
tapestry on which were depicted various scenes from the
Siege of Troy. This was removed at the commencement
of the nineteenth century and thrown into a cellar, being
subsequently sold in 1820 for the paltry sum of £10, and
beneath it was found the series of paintings&mdash;representing
the Wars of the Maccabees and scenes from the life of
Edward the Confessor&mdash;from which the Chamber derived
its name. It was in this apartment that the death warrant
of Charles I. was signed, when Oliver Cromwell and Henry
Martin distinguished themselves by childishly blacking one
another's faces with ink. Here Charles II. lay in state after
his death, as did also Chatham and William Pitt.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Painted Chamber was the room in which
the Peers formerly met and sat, and which may therefore be
styled the old House of Lords. The Prince's Chamber,
afterwards the Robing Room of the Lords, was decorated
with elaborate tapestries, of Dutch workmanship, representing
the destruction of the Spanish Armada, which had been presented
to Queen Elizabeth by the States of Holland, and
subsequently sold by Lord Howard to James I. These
tapestries were afterwards transferred to the Court of Requests,
and, when the greater part of the Palace of Westminster was
destroyed by fire in October, 1834, perished in the flames.</p>

<p>It was proposed, in 1834, to find temporary quarters for
the Court of Bankruptcy in the old tally-room of the exchequer.
For this purpose it became necessary to remove several cartloads
of old "tallies" which had accumulated during past
years and were likely to interfere with the arrangements.
These tallies were nothing but pieces of wood on which were
recorded by a primitive method of notches the sums paid into
the exchequer. The system dated from the Conquest and,
though it had been officially abolished in 1783, was still in
use as late as 1826. Old tallies were usually burnt on
bonfires in Tothill fields or in Palace Yard, but in 1834 some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
official of an economical turn of mind decided to make use
of them as fuel for the stoves of the House of Lords. The
workmen engaged upon the work shared with all honest
British labourers the desire to finish their job as quickly as
possible and get home to their tea. They consequently piled
the tallies into the stoves with more energy than discretion,
little dreaming of the possible effect upon the overheated
furnaces.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of October,
some visitors who were being shown round the House of
Lords observed that the floor was very hot under their feet,
and that the Chamber seemed to be half filled with smoke.
They were reassured by the officials, and no further notice
was taken of their remarks. Two hours later the tallies had
done their work, the flues were red-hot, one of the walls was
well alight, and flames were seen to be issuing from the
windows of the House. The alarm was immediately given.
Fire-engines were hastily summoned to the scene, and police
and troops assembled in force in Palace Yard.</p>

<p>The appliances for coping with any but the mildest of
conflagrations were then altogether inadequate, and it soon
became evident that most of the Palace was doomed. Vast
crowds had meanwhile gathered to witness the destruction of
the parliament building, while peers and members hastened
to Westminster to assist in the work of salvage. Hume, who
had so often tried to obtain for the Commons a Chamber
more suitable to their needs, was one of the first to arrive,
and did yeoman service in saving the contents of the House of
Commons Library.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> He was chaffingly accused of being the
author of the fire, and, as the ancient home of the Commons
rose in smoke to the sky, his friends declared that his motion
for a new House was being "carried without a division."
Lord Althorp, another interested spectator, cared even less
for the preservation of St. Stephen's Chapel than did Hume.
"D&mdash;&mdash; the House of Commons!" he cried, "Save, oh, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the Hall!"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> His wish was gratified, and Westminster Hall,
together with the old House of Lords and the Painted
Chamber, was among the few buildings snatched from the
flames. St. Stephen's Crypt, situated underneath the old
House of Commons, survived not only the fire, but also the
subsequent rebuilding.</p>

<p>When the flames had at last been extinguished, or had
died down from sheer lack of fuel, and the extent of the
damage had been ascertained, Parliament assembled once
more&mdash;the Lords in what remained of their library, the
Commons in one of the surviving committee rooms. It was
then decided temporarily to fit up the old House of Lords
for the use of the Commons, and to relegate the Peers to the
Painted Chamber, until steps could be taken to provide the
Great Council of the nation with a more suitable home.</p>

<p>In the following year, British architects were invited to
submit designs for the new Houses of Parliament, which it
was proposed to erect on the site of the old Palace of Westminster,
and, in 1836, the design of Charles Barry was selected
from some ninety-seven others. With as little delay as
possible the work was put into the hands of the successful
competitor, and on April, 27, 1840, the first stone was laid
without ceremony by the architect's wife.</p>

<p>From that moment until the completion of the building,
poor Barry's life was made a burden to him by the continual
petty interference of the authorities. Perpetual squabbles
arose between the architect and the superintending officials
over every point of the construction&mdash;even the contract for
the manufacture of the clock gave rise to an acrimonious
controversy&mdash;while the question of expense was a never
ending source of worry and difficulty.</p>

<p>Barry's original design had included the enclosing of New
Palace Yard, and the building of a huge gate-tower at the
angles. He had also proposed to make Victoria Tower the
chief feature of a big quadrangle, whence a splendid processional
approach should extend to Buckingham Palace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
The cost of such a scheme, however, precluded its execution,
and the architect had to content himself with the present
magnificent group of buildings, too well known to require
detailed description, which form the best possible memorial
to Sir Charles Barry's genius.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>In 1852 Queen Victoria entered the new Houses of Parliament
for the first time, and some eight years later the whole
building was completed.</p>

<p>The fire of 1834 proved a blessing in disguise. The
ancient congeries of huddled buildings, to which additions
had been made in various styles by so many kings, and which
went by the name of the Palace of Westminster, had long
ceased to provide a suitable home for the Mother of Parliaments.
From the ashes of the royal residence arose at
length a structure worthy to rank with any legislative building
in the world, and adequate to the requirements of that
national council which controls the destiny of the British
Empire.</p>

<p>Towering above both Houses stands the lofty clock-tower
which is one of the landmarks of the metropolis.
From its summit "Big Ben"&mdash;the successor to "Great Tom
of Westminster"&mdash;booms forth the hours, while still higher
burns that nightly light which shows to a sleeping city that
the faithful Commons remain vigilant and at work.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The new Upper Chamber, with its harmonious decorations
of gilt and stained glass, its crimson benches, and its atmosphere
of dignity and repose, supplies a perfect stage for the
leisurely deliberations of our hereditary legislators, and forms
a becoming background for such picturesque pageants as the
Opening of Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>The present House of Commons, though too small to
accommodate a full assemblage of its members, makes up in
comfort for what it may lack in space. The Chamber is
illuminated by a strong light from the glass roof above; the
green benches are cushioned and comfortable. At one end
is the Speaker's chair, and in front of it the table&mdash;that
"substantial piece of furniture," as Disraeli called it, when
he thanked Providence that its bulk was interposed between
Mr. Gladstone and himself&mdash;upon which Sir Robert Peel
used to strike resonant blows at regular two-minute intervals
during his speeches. On this table lies the heavy despatch-box
which countless Premiers have thumped, and which still
bears the impress of Gladstone's signet ring. Here, too,
reposes the mace, that ancient symbol of the royal authority.</p>

<p>The mace is, perhaps, the most important article of furniture&mdash;if
it can be so described&mdash;in the House. Its absence or
loss is an even more appalling catastrophe than would be the
absence of the Speaker. It is possible to provide a substitute
for the latter, but there is no deputy-mace, and without it
the House cannot be held to be properly constituted. The
present mace is engraved with the initials "C. R." and
the royal arms, and is the one that was made at the
Restoration, to replace Cromwell's "bauble," which disappeared
with the Crown plate in 1649. It is kept at the
Tower of London when the House is not sitting, and the
fact that its absence prevents the conduct of any business
has been, on one occasion at least, the cause of grave
inconvenience. In the middle of the last century Parliament
adjourned for the day in order to attend a great naval review
at Spithead, and was timed to meet again at 10 p.m. The
special return-train containing members of the House of
Commons was run in two portions, and the official who
held the key of the mace-cupboard happened to be travelling
in the second. As this was an hour late in arriving, the
House had to postpone its meeting until eleven at night.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Upon the position of the mace a great deal depends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
When the mace lies <i>upon</i> the table, says Hatsell, the House
is a House; "when <i>under</i>, it is a Committee. When <i>out</i> of
the House, no business can be done; when <i>from</i> the table and
upon the Sergeant's shoulder, the Speaker alone manages."
On the famous occasion in 1626, when Sir John Eliot
offered a remonstrance against "tonnage and poundage,"
when Speaker Finch refused to put the question, and the
House almost came to blows, Sergeant-at-Arms Edward
Grimston tried to close the sitting by removing the mace.
At once a fiery member, Sir Miles Hobart, seized it from
him, replaced it on the table, locked the door of the House,
and put the key in his pocket, thus excluding Black Rod,
who was on his way to the Commons with a message from
the king.</p>

<p>The Sergeant-at-Arms is custodian of the mace. Attired
in his tight-fitting black coat, knee-breeches, and buckled
shoes, with his sword at his side, he carries it ceremoniously
upon his shoulder whenever he accompanies the Speaker in
or out of the Chamber. He is also, as we shall see, responsible
for the maintenance of order within the precincts of
the House, and is provided with a chair near the Bar,
whence he can obtain a good view of the whole Chamber.</p>

<p>The arrangements made for the convenience and personal
comfort of a modern legislator are of the most elaborate and
thoughtful kind. Members of the Government, Whips, and
the Leader of the Opposition are provided with private rooms
in which to do their work. The needs of humbler politicians
are no less carefully considered. By means of an intricate
system of ventilation the atmosphere of both Houses is maintained
at an equable temperature, summer and winter. The
very air inhaled by our politicians is so cleansed and rarefied
by a system of water-sprays, of cotton-wool screens and ice-chambers,
that it reaches their lungs in a filtered condition,
free from all those impurities of dust and fog which are part
of the less-favoured Londoner's daily pabulum.</p>

<p>The statesman who seeks a momentary relaxation from
the arduous duties of the Chamber can find repose in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
comfortable smoking-rooms where easy-chairs abound. He
may stroll upon the Terrace in the cool of the evening, enjoying
the society of such lady friends as he may have invited to
tea, and watching the stately procession of barges and steamers
that flows by him. (Occasionally the barges are loaded with
unsavoury refuse, of which his scandalized nostrils are made
unpleasantly aware. Sometimes, too, some wag in a passing
excursion-boat facetiously bids him return to his work in
the House.) Heated by an unusually warm debate, or tired
out by a lengthy sitting, he may retire to spend a pleasant
half-hour in luxurious bathrooms, whence division bells
summon him in vain. His intellectual wants are ministered
to in well-furnished libraries, whose courteous custodians are
ever ready to impart information, to look up parliamentary
precedents, and otherwise to add to his store of knowledge.
His inner man is generously catered for by a Kitchen Committee,
composed of the gourmets of the House, who choose
his wine and cigars, and watch over the cooking of his food
with a vigilant and fastidious eye. His meals are appetising
and at the same time inexpensive, and, as he sits in the
spacious dining-rooms set apart for his use, his mind may
travel back with kindly scorn to the days when his political
ancestors drank their cups of soup at Alice's coffee-house,
munched the homely fare supplied in Bellamy's kitchen,
or satisfied their hunger in even simpler fashion on the
benches of the House itself. Lord Morpeth, who was a
Minister of the Crown in 1840, used always to suck
oranges on the Treasury bench during the course of his
own speeches. Fox ate innumerable dry biscuits on the
hottest nights. David Hume, whose devotion to duty prevented
him from leaving his seat in the Chamber, was in the
habit of providing himself with a generous supply of pears,
which he consumed while his less conscientious colleagues
were slaking their thirst in Bellamy's finest port.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> During a
twenty-one hours' sitting in August, 1880, a member (Mr. A. M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Sullivan) brought a large bag of buns into the House, and
enjoyed what Mr. Labouchère called "a palpable supper."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
The sight of a member of Parliament enjoying an <i>al fresco</i>
meal under the eye of the Speaker would to-day arouse
indignant shouts of "Order!" Even the simple sandwich is
taboo in the Chamber of either House, and nothing more
solid or more potent than a glass of pure well-water, or
perhaps an egg-flip, can be partaken of during debate.</p>

<p>Could Pitt return to the scene of his former triumphs, he
would indeed marvel at the splendours of the modern parliamentary
restaurant&mdash;Pitt, whose thoughts even upon his deathbed
are said to have reverted lovingly to the delights of the
old House of Commons kitchen. "I think I could eat one of
Bellamy's pork pies" were the great statesman's last words
as he expired at Putney in January, 1806, and it was no
doubt at Bellamy's humble board that he drank many a
bottle of that wine for which he entertained so strong a
predilection.</p>

<p>Pearson, the famous doorkeeper of the House of Commons,
has described Bellamy's as "a damn'd good house, upstairs,
where I have drank many a pipe of red port. Here the
members, who cannot say more than 'Yes' or 'No' below,
can speechify for hours to Mother Bellamy about beef-steaks
and pork-chops. Sir Watkin Lewes always dresses them
there himself; and I'll be curst if he ben't a choice hand at
a beef-steak and a bottle, as well as a pot and a pipe."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Dickens, in his "Sketches by Boz," has left a picture of
that old-fashioned eating-room, with the large open fire, the
roasting-jack, the gridiron, the deal tables and wax candles,
the damask linen cloths, and the bare floor, where peers and
members of Parliament assembled with their friends<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> to sit
over their modest meals until it was time for a division, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
as Sheil says, "the whipper-in aroused them to the only
purpose for which their existence was recognized."</p>

<p>Old Bellamy, a wine-merchant by profession, was in 1773
appointed Deputy-Housekeeper to the House of Commons,
and provided with a kitchen, a dining-room, and a small
subsidy to cover his expenses as parliamentary caterer. After
nearly forty years' service in this capacity he was succeeded
by his son John, who continued to control the culinary department
until well into the last century. Refreshments of a
serious kind were not really required by politicians until the
days when Parliament took to sitting late at night. In 1848,
however, Bellamy's system of supplying members with food
was not considered sufficiently adequate, and a select committee
was appointed to inquire into it. As soon as Parliament
reassembled in the new Palace of Westminster, after
the fire, the catering of the House of Commons was taken
over by a Kitchen Committee, while that of the Lords was
placed in the hands of a contractor.</p>

<p>In the days of the Bellamys the charges for solid refreshments
were not really high&mdash;the caterer relied very largely for
his profits upon the sale of wine&mdash;but in comparison with the
tariff of to-day they must appear exorbitant. For half-a-crown
Bellamy provided his patrons with a meal consisting
of cold meat, bread and cheese; double that sum secured a
liberal dinner, which included tart and a salad. Claret cost
10s. a bottle, while a similar quantity of port and madeira
was to be had for 6<i>s.</i> or 8<i>s.</i> To-day a member of Parliament
can be supplied with a dinner of several courses for the
modest sum of 1<i>s.</i>, and every item on the daily bill of fare
is proportionately inexpensive.</p>

<p>Bellamy's was not only the eating-place of Parliament; it
also partook of some of the qualities of the modern smoking-room
as a refuge from debate. The sudden concourse of
members who came hurrying into the kitchen as soon as a
bore rose to his feet in the House has been amusingly described
by Sheil in his essay on John Leslie Foster. Poor Mr. Foster
seems to have exercised an extraordinarily clearing effect upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the House. The first words of his speech were the signal for
a unanimous excursion of his fellows, and he was left in full
possession of that solitude which he ever had the unrivalled
power of creating. Members hastened to the kitchen where
the tiresome voice of the parliamentary bore could not
penetrate, and there indulged themselves in conversation,
eked out with tea or stronger beverages. "The scene which
Bellamy's presents to a stranger is striking enough," says
Sheil. "Two smart girls, whose briskness and neat attire
made up for their want of beauty, and for the invasions of
time, of which their cheeks showed the traces, helped out tea
in a room in the corridor. It was pleasant to observe the
sons of dukes and marquises, and the possessors of twenties
and thirties of thousands a year, gathered round these damsels,
and soliciting a cup of that beverage which it was their office
to administer. These Bellamy barmaids seemed so familiarized
with their occupation that they went through it with perfect
nonchalance, and would occasionally turn with petulance, in
which they asserted the superiority of their sex to rank and
opulence, from the noble or wealthy suitors for a draught of
tea, by whom they were surrounded." The unfortunate Irish
members, we are told, were regarded with a peculiar disdain,
being continually reminded of their provinciality by the
scornful looks of these parliamentary Hebes, who treated
them "as mere colonial deputies should be received in the
purlieus of the State." Dickens, too, describes how one of the
waitresses, Jane by name, who was something of a character,
would playfully dig the handle of a fork into the arm of some
too amorous member who sought to detain her.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> "I passed
from these ante-chambers to the tavern," continues Sheil,
"where I found a number of members assembled at dinner.
Half an hour had passed away, tooth-picks and claret were
now beginning to appear, and the business of mastication being
concluded, that of digestion had commenced, and many an
honourable gentleman, I observed, seemed to prove that he
was born only to digest. At the end of a long corridor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
which opened from the room where the diners were assembled,
there stood a waiter, whose office it was to inform any interrogator
what gentleman was speaking below stairs. Nearly
opposite the door sat two English county members. They
had disposed of a bottle each, and just as the last glass was
emptied, one of them called out to the annunciator at the end
of the passage for intelligence. 'Mr. Foster on his legs,'
was the formidable answer. 'Waiter, bring another bottle!'
was the immediate effect of this information, which was
followed by a similar injunction from every table in the room.
I perceived that Mr. Bellamy owed great obligations to Mr.
Foster. But the latter did not limit himself to a second
bottle; again and again the same question was asked, and
again the same announcement was returned&mdash;'Mr. Foster
upon his legs!' The answer seemed to fasten men in inseparable
adhesiveness to their seats. Thus hours went by,
when, at length, 'Mr. Plunket on his legs!' was heard from
the end of the passage, and the whole convocation of compotators
rose together and returned to the House."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Alas! Bellamy's roaring fire is long extinguished, his
candles have burnt down to their sockets, and been replaced
by electric light. The comfortable days of lengthy dinners
are past and gone, and the modern member has barely time
to snatch a hasty meal in the Commons' dining-room ere he
returns to the bustle and confusion of the House. Things
have indeed changed since the leisurely days when Bellamy
could adequately cater for the needs of Parliament. His
small staff and humble kitchen would have but little chance
of satisfying modern requirements in an age when over a
hundred thousand meals are served to members and their
friends in the course of a single session.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>HIS MAJESTY'S SERVANTS</h3>


<p>Parliament is not an administrative body. Summoned
by the Crown, with its assent it passes laws,
gives and takes away rights, authorises and directs taxation
and expenditure; but in executive business the Crown acts
through Ministers who are not appointed by Parliament,
though undoubtedly responsible to it for their conduct.</p>

<p>Alfred the Great called together Councils, which in some
ways resembled our present Cabinets or the Privy Council,
to consider such measures as were afterwards submitted to
the Witenagemot. In William the Conqueror's time the
<i>Curia Regis</i> was the Great Council which he consulted on
questions of State policy. Later on, in Henry I.'s reign, the
King formed a smaller consultative body from the royal
household, whose duty it was to deal with administrative
details, legislation being left in the hands of the National
Council.</p>

<p>In Tudor days the Sovereign had almost dispensed with
Parliament altogether&mdash;in the course of Queen Elizabeth's
lengthy reign it was only summoned thirteen times&mdash;and the
country was governed autocratically by the monarch, with
the aid of his Privy Council. This advisory body varied in
size from year to year. In Henry VIII.'s reign it consisted
of about a dozen members; later on, the number was much
increased. In time the Privy Council became too large and
cumbersome an assembly to act together without friction, and
was gradually subdivided into various committees, to each
of which was given some specific legislative function.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>In the reign of Edward VI. one of these smaller bodies
was known as the Committee of State, and from this has
slowly developed the Cabinet to which we are accustomed
to-day. When the Great Council of Peers was convened at
York in 1640, the Committee of State was reproachfully
referred to as the "Cabinet Council,"&mdash;from the fact that its
meetings were held in a small room in the Royal Palace,&mdash;and
afterwards as the "Juncto." It consisted of the Archbishop
of Canterbury, the Earl of Strafford, and a few other
leading men, and met at odd times to discuss important
intelligence, the Privy Council only meeting when specially
summoned.</p>

<p>James I. acquired the habit of entrusting his confidence to
a few advisers, and his successors followed suit. The inner
council, or cabal, thus originated, was the cause of much
parliamentary jealousy and popular suspicion. After the fall
of Clarendon in 1677, and of Danby twelve years later,
Charles II. promised, in accordance with the general desire,
to be governed by the Privy Council, and to have no secrets
from that body. It soon became evident, however, that the
King had no intention of keeping his promise, and the
Remonstrance of 1682 complained that great affairs of State
were still managed "in Cabinet Councils, by men unknown,
and not publicly trusted."</p>

<p>In Stuart days the Commons had grown in strength from
year to year, and the Privy Council had weakened proportionately,
though it had increased in size. Besides being so
unwieldy as to be impracticable for administrative purposes,
it was largely composed of men who were not in any way
fitted for the post of responsible advisers. Naunton, writing
of Elizabeth's day, observed that "there were of the Queen's
Councell that were not in the Catalogue of Saints."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> And
much the same criticism would apply to the Privy Councillors
of Stuart times. The inner Cabinet, therefore, gradually
assumed all the more important functions of the Legislature,
and eventually became the ruling power in the State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>In the time of Charles II. the Ministry was not a united
body, but was composed of men of different political opinions,
each of whom held his office at the King's pleasure. The
Cabinet long remained, therefore, in a disorganised and
subordinate condition, largely dependent upon the royal will.
Under the Tudors and Stuarts, Ministers were the masters or
servants of the Crown, according as the Sovereign was a weak
or a strong one. They did not necessarily sit in Parliament,
nor did they act together in response to the views of a
parliamentary majority. The Cabinet itself consisted of an
inner group of responsible advisers and an outer circle of
members with whom they often differed fundamentally.
There was no need for unanimity of political thought in the
Cabinet of those days, so long as its members were unanimous
in their subservience to the King.</p>

<p>After the Revolution of 1688, however, the powers of
the Crown were limited and those of Parliament extended.
Ministers now customarily sat in Parliament, and gradually
acquired unanimity of thought and purpose, working together
with common responsibility and for common interests.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The
Cabinet thus became what Walter Bagehot calls a "combining
committee&mdash;a hyphen which joins, a buckle which fastens,
the legislative to the executive part of the State"&mdash;and
remained an essentially deliberative assembly, as opposed
to the Privy Council, or administrative body.</p>

<p>William III. had begun by convening mixed Cabinets of
Whigs and Tories, but in 1693 he determined to appoint
Ministers all of one party, and in two years his Cabinet was
entirely composed of Whigs. This example was followed by
his successor, though unwillingly, and the Cabinet system, as
we understand it to-day, may be said to date from the
moment when Godolphin forced Queen Anne to accept
Sunderland, and, later, to remove Harley, in accordance with
the views expressed by the country at elections.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
By this time Parliament had learnt to tolerate the idea of
a Cabinet, and the word itself appears for the first time
officially in the Lords' Address to the Queen in 1711. In
that year a lengthy debate took place on the meaning of the
words "Cabinet Council," several peers preferring the term
"Ministers." Among the latter was the Earl of Peterborough,
who declared that sometimes there was no Minister at all in
the Cabinet Council. He seems to have regarded the
members of the Privy Council and of the Cabinet with equal
contempt. The Privy Councillors, he said, "were such as
were thought to know everything and knew nothing, and
the Cabinet Councillors those who thought that nobody
knew anything but themselves."</p>

<p>When Walpole was Prime Minister, the country was
governed by three bodies&mdash;the Great Council, somewhat
similar to the modern Privy Council; the Committee of
Council, a smaller assembly which met at the Cockpit in
Whitehall, and seems to have concerned itself chiefly with
foreign affairs; and the Cabinet.</p>

<span class="caption">SIR ROBERT WALPOLE<br />
FROM THE PAINTING BY FRANCIS HAYMAN, R.A., IN THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY</span>
</div>

<p>The members of the Cabinet varied in number from eight
to fourteen, and included the Great Officers of the Royal
Household. In April, 1740, for instance, it consisted of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord
President of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord
Steward, the Lord Chamberlain, the Master of the Horse,
the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, two Secretaries of State,
the Groom of the Stole, the First Minister for Scotland, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First Commissioner of the
Admiralty, and the Master of the Ordnance. Besides these,
the Duke of Bolton was also included, for the somewhat
inadequate reason that "he had been of it seven years ago."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
As such an immense body must have been quite unmanageable
from a business point of view, there also existed an
interior council, consisting of Walpole, the Lord Chancellor,
and the two Secretaries of State, who consulted together,
in the first instance, on the more confidential points, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
reported the result of their deliberations to the rest of the
Cabinet.</p>

<p>The size and composition of a Cabinet is a question which
has always been left entirely to the discretion of the Prime
Minister. In 1770 and 1783, when Lord North and Pitt were
Premiers, the number was reduced to seven. Later on, this
was increased; but Lord Wellesley, in 1812, expressed his
conviction that thirteen was an inconveniently large number,
and Sir Robert Peel, some twenty years later, declared that
the Executive Government would be infinitely better conducted
by a Cabinet composed of only nine members.</p>

<p>Among His Majesty's advisers in Georgian days, and
earlier, peers usually preponderated. The younger Pitt was
the only Commoner in his first Cabinet. Nowadays both
Houses are suitably represented.</p>

<p>There is no definite rule laid down as to which posts in
the Administration carry with them a seat in the Cabinet;
but the First Lord of the Treasury, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Lord President
of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal, and the Lord
Chancellor are invariably included. Statesmen who hold
no office at all, as we have seen in the case of the Duke of
Bolton, have occasionally been given a seat. Hyde, afterwards
Lord Clarendon, sat in Charles I.'s Cabinet without
office; and, later on, Lord Fitzwilliam, the Duke of Wellington,
and Lord John Russell were each accorded a similar privilege.
Lord Mansfield, on his elevation to the seat of the Lord Chief
Justice, in 1756, became a member of the Cabinet, and did
not cease to take part in the discussions until 1765. The
precedent he thus created was afterwards cited in the case
of Lord Ellenborough, another Lord Chief Justice, who was
admitted to the Cabinet of "All the Talents" in 1806. By
this time, however, the inclusion of any but the actual holders
of parliamentary offices was considered unusual, and it has
never been repeated.</p>

<p>Cabinet meetings in Charles II.'s time were first of all
held twice a week, and then on Sunday evenings. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
long customary for the Sovereign to be present, and Queen
Anne presided regularly over these Sunday gatherings.
Indeed, the absence of the King from Cabinet meetings
did not occur until the time of George I., and only arose
from that monarch's inability to speak English. Since his
day, however, no Sovereign has thought it necessary, or even
politic, to attend.</p>

<p>Besides the regular official meetings of the Cabinet,
informal gatherings of Ministers were occasionally convened.
Walpole used often to invite a few colleagues to dinner to
discuss the affairs of the nation, and in the Aberdeen Government
a Cabinet dinner was held weekly.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> After the tablecloth
had been removed, and the port began to circulate,
measures of State were agitated and discussed, and questions
of policy decided upon. Whether Ministers were always
in a condition fit for the consideration of such grave topics
is a matter of doubt. Lord Chancellor Thurlow sometimes
refused to take part in these post-prandial discussions. "He
has even more than once left his colleagues to deliberate,"
says Wraxall, "whilst he sullenly stretched himself along the
chair, and fell, or appeared to fall, fast asleep."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The Cabinet no longer meets on Sundays, and the practice
of holding weekly dinners has been given up. It has no
regular times of assembling, but can be summoned at any
moment when the Prime Minister wishes to consult his
colleagues. It is not necessary for all the members of the
Cabinet to be present, as no quorum is needed to validate
the proceedings, nor is there any rule laid down as to the
length of a Cabinet meeting, which may last from a brief
half-hour to as much as half a day.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
The chief point with regard to Cabinet meetings is their
absolute secrecy. No minutes are kept, no secretary or clerk
is present, and only in exceptional circumstances is some
private record made of any matter that may have been
discussed. The meetings are usually held at No. 10, Downing
Street, the official residence of the Prime Minister, or occasionally
at the Foreign Office, a practice instituted by Lord
Salisbury when he was Foreign Secretary, his Cabinet being
so large that the room in Downing Street could barely
contain it.</p>

<p>In George II.'s time, No. 10, Downing Street&mdash;called after
Sir George Downing, a statesman of Charles II.'s day, whom
Pepys styles "a niggardly fellow"&mdash;belonged to the Crown,
and was the town residence of Bothmar, the Hanoverian
Minister. On the latter's death, King George offered the
house to Walpole as a gift. The Prime Minister declined it,
however, and suggested that it should henceforward accompany
the offices of the First Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor
of the Exchequer. Externally the Prime Minister's house is
not a very imposing structure, but the traditions attached to
it as the official residence of so many eminent Englishmen
enchance its value in the eyes of its occupants and of the public.</p>

<p>Here, then, the Cabinet assembles to discuss the problems
of Empire, whose solution at times of stress the country awaits
with such breathless interest. Here the Prime Minister presides
over that assembly which, however internally discordant,
must ever present an harmonious and united front to the public.
The decisions arrived at by "His Majesty's Servants"&mdash;no
longer known as the "Lords of the Cabinet Council," as in
olden times&mdash;must always be presumably unanimous. Each
Minister is held responsible for the opinions of the Cabinet as a
whole. His only escape from such responsibility lies in resignation,
in either sense of that word. The defending and supporting
in public of what they are really opposed to in private,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
is the common practice of Ministers. It is thought that one
man's scruples should yield to the judgment of the many, and
"minorities must suffer" that Governments may be carried
on and Ministries remain undivided.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> There is a well-known
story of Lord Melbourne's Ministry which illustrates this
point. The Government had proposed to put an eight-shilling
duty on corn. Melbourne, who was strongly opposed
to the tax, found himself out-voted and overruled by the
other members of the Cabinet. At the end of the meeting he
put his back against the door. "Now, is it to lower the price
of corn, or isn't it?" he asked. "It doesn't much matter
what we say, but mind, we must all say the same!" In 1860,
again, Lord Palmerston as Prime Minister was in favour of
the House of Lords throwing out the Paper Duties Bill, which
was the measure of his own Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>It is not perhaps easy to imagine a modern Premier being
placed in a situation similar to that of either Lord Melbourne
or Lord Palmerston. He must necessarily, to a certain extent,
have the whip hand of the Cabinet. For if several of his
colleagues disagree with him on a question of principle, and
resign, he can generally appoint others; whereas, if he resigns,
the whole Ministry crumbles and falls to pieces.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister nowadays has indeed acquired a
position which is almost that of a dictator. In many ways
his power is absolute and his will autocratic. More especially
is this true as regards his dealings with the Crown. In olden
days he was the servant and creature of the sovereign. He
had no voice in the selection of his colleagues; he acted
merely as His Majesty's chief adviser, and, as such, was liable
to instant dismissal. When Pelham resigned in 1746, because
he could no longer agree with the King, he was acting in a
fashion that was then unprecedented. Before that time, a
Prime Minister whose views did not coincide with those of
his sovereign, was summarily dismissed. Many kings had,
indeed, been in the habit of themselves undertaking the duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of Prime Minister&mdash;Charles II. delighted in referring to
himself as his own <i>Premier Ministre</i>, though he was far too
indolent to perform the work of that official&mdash;and merely
looked upon their chief adviser as a convenient channel of
communication between themselves and Parliament.</p>

<p>It was not until the eighteenth century that a Premier of
the modern type came into existence. With the development
of the party system, the gradual growth of the Cabinet's
prestige, and the consequent weakening of the sovereign's prerogatives,
the Prime Minister ceased to be the choice of the
Crown, and became the nominee of the nation. As the leader
of the party in office, he acquired the unquestioned right of
selecting his own Ministers. To-day, though the King still
nominally chooses his Prime Minister, little individual freedom
is left to the sovereign, who is guided in his choice by the
advice of the outgoing Premier and his interpretation of the
wishes of the country.</p>

<p>For a very long time the very name of Prime Minister stank
in the nostrils of the public and of Parliament. The word
"Premier" was used in 1746,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> but as late as 1761 we find
George Grenville in a debate in the Commons declaring
"Prime Minister" to be an odious title. The holder of it long
occupied an anomalous position. Legally and constitutionally
he had no superiority over any other Privy Councillor.
Eight members of the Cabinet took precedence of him, by
virtue of office&mdash;a fact which naturally resulted in situations
puzzling to the lay mind&mdash;the exact rank of the Prime
Minister being apparently impossible to define. When Lord
Palmerston visited Scotland in 1863, the commander of the
naval guardship was very anxious to receive that distinguished
statesman with all the ceremony befitting his exalted position.
On the subject of salutes due to a Prime Minister the naval
code-book unfortunately maintained an impenetrable silence,
and gave the officer no information as to how he should act.
He eventually solved the difficulty in a thoroughly tactful
manner by giving Palmerston the salute of nineteen guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
which were due to him as Lord Warden of the Cinq Ports.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Mr. Gladstone, who was ever most punctilious in matters of
etiquette, always resolutely declined to leave a room in front
of any person of higher social rank, and many a youthful
peer vainly endeavoured to induce the aged Prime Minister
to precede him.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister continued to occupy an ambiguous
position until quite recently. It was not, indeed, until the
close of Mr. Balfour's Premiership that his proper precedence
was recognised. Matters were simplified, however, when he
held some ministerial office, as First Lord of the Treasury,
Lord President of the Council, or Foreign Secretary, whereby
he became entitled to an adequate salary and an assured, if
inadequate, precedence.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole, who held the Premiership for twenty-one
years&mdash;though not consecutively<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>&mdash;was the first Prime
Minister in the modern sense of the word, the first to sit in
the Commons, and the first to resign because of an adverse
vote of Parliament.</p>

<p>Walpole was in many ways a model Premier. Though not,
indeed, as incorruptible as Harley, he yet possessed many
of the qualities which contributed to that statesman's success.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
It was not genius, it was not eloquence, it was not statesmanship
that gave Harley his astounding power in Parliament, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Forster has remarked; it was "House of Commons tact." Sir
Robert Peel, Lord John Russell, and Disraeli each understood
that art of "managing Parliament," which is probably of far
greater value to a Prime Minister than either virtue or eloquence.
Lord Rockingham, George Grenville, and Lord
Bute&mdash;the last uttering his words with hesitation and at
long intervals, causing Charles Townshend to liken them
to "minute-guns"&mdash;each lacked that power of oratory for
which another Premier, Lord Derby, the "Rupert of debate,"
was more famous than for any intellectual ability.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Lord
Castlereagh had a great influence with his party, and was
a most successful leader of the House of Commons. Yet
he was a shocking speaker, tiresome, involved, and obscure.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
On one occasion he harangued the House for an hour, during
no single moment of which could any of his hearers make
out what on earth he was driving at "So much, Mr.
Speaker, for the law of nations!" he finally exclaimed, as
he prepared to turn to other matters.</p>

<p>Parliament will, indeed, put up with a great deal from a
Minister whose honesty is unquestioned, and who has sufficient
common-sense not to blunder at a moment of crisis. Nowadays,
however, no man who was utterly lacking in ordinary
power of speaking would be given a place on the front bench.
A talent for debate may not necessarily be a gauge of a
man's capacity as a Minister, but only in debate can he show
his powers. His success in Parliament is a test of intellect, for
there, at any rate, he cannot conceal departmental ignorance.
But it requires judgment, ability, and tact to become a
leader. Charm and personal magnetism are the qualities
that endear a man to his followers. A kindly word, a smile,
or a glance of recognition will often win the affection of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
supporter more surely than the most eloquent speech, and it
was in this respect that Lord John Russell, Gladstone, and
Lord Salisbury, either from shortness of sight or absence of
mind, failed. The same qualities which young Grattan considered
necessary for a successful leader of Opposition may
also prove invaluable to a Prime Minister. "He must be
affable in manner, generous in disposition, have a ready hand,
an open house, and a full purse. He must have a good cook
for the English members, fine words and fair promises for the
Irish, and sober calculations for the Scotch."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> He must,
indeed, be a man who breeds confidence and inspires affection
among his subordinates.</p>

</div>

<p>Men in the House of Commons, as Bolingbroke said,
"grow, like hounds, fond of the man who shows them sport,
and by whose halloos they are used to be encouraged." If,
in addition, the Prime Minister possesses singleness of purpose
and supreme self-confidence, his power in Parliament is
supreme. The "Great Commoner" owed his political success
as much to his courage and assurance as to his splendid gifts
as an orator. "I know that I can save the country," he once
observed to the Duke of Devonshire, "and I know that no
other man can!"<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The Duke of Cumberland, a political
adversary, described him very justly when he said that he was
"that rare thing&mdash;a man!" His position in the House of
Commons was in many ways unique. His very presence
seemed to instil fear into the hearts of his opponents, and
promote confidence in those of his supporters. A member
named Moreton, Chief Justice of Chester, in a speech in the
Lower House, once made some allusion to "King, Lords, and
Commons, or, as that Right Honourable Member"&mdash;looking
across at Pitt&mdash;"would call them, Commons, Lords, and
King!" The Prime Minister rose at once in that slow
dignified manner which always commanded silence, and,
fixing the speaker with a cold and terrifying gaze, asked the
Clerk of the House to make a note of Moreton's words. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
have heard frequently in this house doctrines that have surprised
me," he said; "but now my blood runs cold!" Moreton,
in some alarm, hastened to apologise for his ill-chosen words,
saying that he had intended nothing offensive. "King, Lords,
and Commons; Lords, King, and Commons; Commons,
Lords, and King&mdash;<i>tria juncta in uno</i>! Indeed, I meant
nothing!" he explained. Pitt gravely accepted this apology,
but took the opportunity of giving the trembling Moreton
some very sound advice. "Whenever that honourable gentleman
means nothing," he said, in his sternest and most frigid
tones, "I strongly recommend him to say nothing!"</p>

<p>The terror he inspired among his opponents was shown
on another occasion when he replied to an attack of Murray,
the Solicitor-General, afterwards Lord Mansfield. "I must
now address a few words to Mr. Solicitor," said Pitt; "they
shall be few, but they shall be daggers!" Murray at once
became much agitated. "Judge Festus trembles," continued
Pitt relentlessly, pointing his finger on him. "He shall hear
me some other day." He sat down, Murray made no reply,
and a languid debate showed the paralysis of the House.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>It was not only in Parliament that Pitt's power made
itself felt, or that his words were received with a kind of
reverential awe bordering on terror. Government officials
knew well that he was not a man to be trifled with, or, if they
did not know it, he soon found occasion to bring the fact to
their notice. Once, when he had sent a message to the
Admiralty saying that the Channel Fleet was to be got
ready to sail on the following Tuesday, the Board of
Admiralty respectfully replied that such a thing was an
impossibility; the time was too short. The Prime Minister
drily rejoined that in that case he would recommend the
King to name a new Board of Admiralty. Needless to say,
the Channel Fleet sailed on Tuesday.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Pitt, indeed, possessed all the attributes of a successful
Prime Minister. He was himself infused with a fervid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
enthusiasm which he could transmit into the hearts of all
who shared his confidences. His courage was infectious.
No man, said Colonel Barré, could come out of the Minister's
private room without feeling himself braver than when he
entered. He was gifted with a serene composure, a perfect
self-possession, and understood the House of Commons as
well as did Disraeli after him, and as well as Lord Salisbury
understood the Lords.</p>

<p>Both these two last statesmen possessed that polished
style, dry humour and sarcasm which are beloved of parliamentary
audiences. Disraeli was the more ornamental
speaker of the two, but seldom wasted time in rhetoric, and,
like Lord North, never weakened his argument by superfluous
declamation. One of the secrets of his success was that he
knew when to keep silent&mdash;knowledge that is of infinite
importance to a Prime Minister. Gladstone&mdash;great as a
Premier, and still greater as Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;could
not always stay his speech. His earnestness and
enthusiasm carried him away, and he thereby often dissipated
in debate those powers which his rival was reserving for great
occasions. Lord Salisbury adopted a studiously common-place
tone in the House; he did not orate, he talked confidentially.
And Parliament has always preferred this quiet fashion of
speaking, to what Dizzy once called the "somewhat sanctimonious
eloquence" of Gladstone. Lord Palmerston's jaunty
manner was far more popular than the exuberant eloquence
of greater orators. People said that they preferred his "ha!
ha!" style to the wit of Canning or the gravity of Peel.</p>

<p>The Premiership is not a bed of roses, and it requires the
phlegm of a Lord North to sleep there at all. It is, no doubt,
the pinnacle of political ambition, but from that giddy height
many a statesman has looked down with envy, like St. Simon
on his column, at the groundlings who walk securely beneath
his feet. Elevation brings with it many disadvantages. The
searchlight of public opinion beats relentlessly upon a Prime
Minister; even his private life is open to criticism. Enemies
lay snares for him on every side; friends and political allies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
have to be treated with tact and tenderness; his labours
never cease, day or night.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> It is his duty, as Gladstone said,
"to stand like a wall of adamant between the people and the
sovereign," and the burden of an Empire hangs heavy upon
his shoulders. From the very moment of a Prime Minister's
appointment his responsibilities commence. Entrusted by
the sovereign with the delicate duty of forming a Ministry,
he is at once faced with a task of exceptional difficulty.
Whom shall he choose? This problem awaits his instant
solution. Luckily, as Bagehot says, the position of most
men in Parliament forbids their being invited to the Cabinet,
while that of a few men ensures their being invited.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Between
the compulsory list, whom he must take, and the impossible
list, whom he cannot take, a Prime Minister's independent
choice is not very large; it extends rather to the division of
the Cabinet offices than to the choice of Cabinet Ministers.</p>

<p>This distribution of places is, however, an invidious duty;
there are so many reasons governing a Premier's choice of his
colleagues. Valuable services to the party have to be
rewarded; the claims of men who have held Cabinet rank in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
former Governments cannot be disregarded; the wishes of
the Sovereign must be considered.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> To satisfy all who
expect office is impossible; to satisfy the few who deserve
it is a laborious and not altogether grateful business. The
statesman whom it is proposed to appoint as Minister for
War may yearn for the Lord Chancellorship; the prospective
President of the Board of Trade desires to become Irish
Secretary. It is for the Prime Minister, by coaxing or
entreaties, to content them both. But there are less pleasant
duties than this to perform. Certain ex-Cabinet Ministers who
have not proved a success in their various departments must
be shelved with as little damage to their feelings as possible;
salves in the form of peerages must be administered to other
aggrieved politicians who have been left out. At times
ex-Ministers who are no longer members of the Cabinet have
shown signs of disinclination to retire. In 1801, for instance,
when Addington became Prime Minister, Lord Loughborough,
who had been Chancellor in Pitt's administration, resigned the
Great Seal, but continued to attend Cabinet meetings, and
Addington was eventually compelled to write and ask him to
deprive the Cabinet of the pleasure of his distinguished
presence.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The manner of appointing a Minister, as also the manner
of acquainting a colleague that his services are no longer
required, varies with different Premiers. One may be as curt
in his methods of appointment as another is in his mode of
dismissal. Walpole and North provide excellent examples
of this. On the death of Lord Chancellor Talbot in 1736-7,
Walpole offered the Great Seal to Lord Hardwicke who was
then Lord Chief Justice. The latter hesitated about accepting
the office, until one day the Prime Minister impatiently
informed him that unless he made up his mind without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
further delay, the Seal would be given to Fazakerley, another
famous lawyer. Hardwicke remonstrated that Fazakerley
was quite unfit for the post of Lord Chancellor, being both
a Tory and a Jacobite. "Never mind," replied Walpole,
pulling out his watch. "It is now exactly noon. If you do
not let me know that you have closed with my offer before
eight o'clock this evening, I can only tell you that, by
twelve, Fazakerley will be as good a Whig as any man
in His Majesty's dominions!" Hardwicke hesitated no
longer.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Lord North's method of dismissing Fox from his Cabinet
in 1774 was no less peremptory. "Sir," wrote the Prime
Minister, "His Majesty has thought proper to order a new
commission of the Treasury to be made out, in which I do
not perceive your name."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>It is seldom that a Prime Minister can give complete
satisfaction in the formation of a Ministry, though the task is
perhaps lightened by the fact that the possession of rare
ability is not an absolute necessity for a Cabinet Minister.</p>

<p>In 1851 the Prince Consort sent Lord Derby the examination
papers which Prince Alfred had been set when he passed
as a naval cadet "As I looked over them," wrote the Prime
Minister in his reply, "I couldn't but feel very grateful that
no such examination was necessary to qualify Her Majesty's
Ministers for their offices, as it would very seriously increase
the difficulty of framing an administration!"</p>

<p>A curious list, as Macaulay suggested, could be made out
of successful Lord Chancellors ignorant of the principles of
equity, and of First Lords of the Admiralty ignorant of the
principles of navigation. Sheridan even went so far as to say
that a competent knowledge of the Rule of Three was a
sufficient qualification for the Chancellorship of the Exchequer.
Fox never understood what was meant by Consols. He only
knew them to be things which rose and fell, and he was
delighted when they fell, because, as he said, it annoyed Pitt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
so much. Lowe, who took a gloomy view of his office,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> always
admitted that he was "a bad hand at figures," and his
financial statements as Chancellor were both obscure and unintelligible.
Lord Randolph Churchill, too, when he was at
the Treasury, is always supposed to have remarked to a clerk
who brought him a list of decimal figures, that he "never
could understand what those d&mdash;&mdash;d dots meant!"</p>

<p>Government departments are to a great extent run by the
permanent officials. As Sir George Lewis, himself successively
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary, and Minister
for War, justly observed, it is not the business of a Cabinet
Minister to work his department. His business is to see that
it is properly worked. If he does too much, he is probably
doing harm. The permanent staff of the office can do what
he chooses to do much better than he, or, if they cannot, they
ought to be removed. Strength of purpose, quickness of
decision, and a good supply of sterling common-sense are
worth more to a Minister than mere technical knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Besides the appointment of his colleagues, the Prime
Minister also has in his patronage a number of posts in the
Royal Household, which become vacant when an Administration
changes. These are not so difficult to fill, and are
usually distributed among members of the House of Lords,
who are thus bound to their party by ties even stronger than
those of sentiment.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The actual Ministry consists of over forty persons, of
whom perhaps a quarter form the Cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
cost to the country in ministerial salaries is well under
£200,000, and cannot therefore be considered excessive,
considering the delicacy of the administrative machine, the
efficiency with which it is run, and the amount of work that
has to be accomplished.</p>

<p>The labours of Cabinet Ministers have increased enormously
in modern times. This is perhaps one of the reasons
why they no longer deem it necessary to attend debates as
regularly as their predecessors. In Disraeli's time all the
members of the Cabinet sat on the Treasury Bench throughout
a debate, and listened attentively to every speech. It
was considered obligatory upon the Leader of the House
to be present perpetually in his place in Parliament. Neither
Gladstone nor Disraeli would have thought of leaving the
Chamber, except for a hurried dinner, until the House rose.
The sittings have become so lengthy of late that it would be
impossible for any Minister thus to give up his whole time
to debate. Ministers are consequently provided with private
rooms within the precincts of the House, whither they betake
themselves as soon as question time is over, leaving one or
two of their number to act as sentinels.</p>

<p>The cup of a young politician's happiness is filled to the
brim on that glad day when he is offered a post in the
Ministry. It does not actually overflow until he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
given a seat in the Cabinet itself. Should such success attend
him, the summit of his ambition is within sight. In imagination
he sees the mantle of Walpole descending upon his
shoulders. Before his eyes stretches a vista of political
splendour which only reaches a glorious conclusion when the
vaults of Westminster Abbey open to receive his ashes.
There is but one fly in the ointment. A member of the
House of Commons who is appointed to ministerial office has
perforce to submit himself once more to the judgment of the
electors, and beg his constituents to return him again to
Parliament. This rule is some two centuries old, and was
designed to prevent the corruption of unworthy members
who might otherwise be bought by the offer of lucrative
Crown appointments.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> It is no longer of any practical value
for this purpose, and so tiresome a practice, entailing as it
does much hardship and expense upon a newly created
Minister, could well be abolished. Old customs die hard,
however, and nowhere do they take so "unconscionably long
a time a-dying" as in Parliament.</p>

<p>The ratification by the sovereign of the Prime Minister's
choice in the matter of colleagues is a brief but not unimposing
ceremony. To each of the three Secretariats of State
there belongs a seal which is the outward and visible sign of
the authority attaching to the post. When a Government
goes out of office and a fresh Ministry is appointed, the seals
are delivered up in person to the sovereign by the outgoing
Ministers. His Majesty then hands them to the members of
the new Administration, who receive their badges of office in
a suitably humble attitude, on their knees, and kiss the royal
hand that confers these favours.</p>

</div>

<p>The seals of office have been the unconscious cause of
more indifferent puns than any other parliamentary institution.
Statesmen who have never previously been guilty of a
sense of humour, and have otherwise led blameless lives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
seem unable to refrain from making little jokes on the subject
of seal fisheries&mdash;jokes which their biographers affectionately
enshrine as epigrams in their published Lives.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> We have
fortunately outgrown such humour as this, and puns are
nowadays only to be found elsewhere among the <i>obiter dicta</i>
of our judges and magistrates upon their respective benches.</p>

<p>The Ministry is now formed. The Prime Minister moves
into Downing Street; his colleagues hasten to make themselves
acquainted with the work of their various departments.
The parliamentary concert is about to commence, and it is
for the Premier as leader of the Government orchestra to keep
his band together as best he may. This is no easy task. A
single false note may mar the harmony of the whole performance;
the failure of one solitary instrumentalist may cause
the dismissal of the entire band. It is the conductor's duty
to see that his orchestra plays in unison, or, if not in unison,
at least in harmony. He must keep a watchful eye upon each
individual, and quash the efforts of any one member to
perform a solo upon his own peculiar trumpet. All round
the platform sit the members of a former band, stern critics
anxious to seize the instruments from the hands of their rivals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and show the public how the tune should be played. Their
chance will soon arrive. For when the concert has gone on
sufficiently long, the popular audience grows weary of the performance
and demands something fresh. Another conductor
is chosen, and another orchestra engaged to play. The old
band is dismissed, and its members are free to return to their
former avocations, wiser no doubt, but perhaps poorer men.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
But though from Parliament to Parliament the performers
may vary and the leaders change, the music remains very
much the same; and, while the country enjoys the privilege
of paying the piper, it is generally the piper who calls the
tune.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</h3>


<p>From the days of Sir Thomas More to the present time
the Woolsack has continuously enriched the annals of
English history with famous and distinguished names.
The well-known biographies of Lord Campbell, whose habit of
writing the lives of the deceased as soon as the breath was
out of their bodies added, as Brougham declared, a new terror
to death, supply abundant evidence of the statesmanlike
qualities that attach to the holders of the office. The most
eminent men of their day have held the Chancellorship,
proving the truth of Burke's well-known assertion that of all
human studies the law is the most efficacious in forming great
men, and that to be well versed in the laws of England is to
be imbued in the sublimest principles of human wisdom.</p>

<p>The office of Chancellor is of very ancient origin.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> It
existed in England in the days of the Anglo-Saxon kings,
when the official who acted as judicial secretary or clerk to
the sovereign is supposed to have derived his title from the
<i>cancelli</i> or screens behind which he carried on his clerical
duties.</p>

<p>After their conversion to Christianity, the kings employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the services of a priest as chaplain or confessor, and in the
person of the Chancellor the posts of "Keeper of the King's
Conscience" and secretary were thus naturally combined. In
King Ethelred's time the Chancellorship was divided between
the Abbots of Ely, Canterbury and Glastonbury, who exercised
it in turn, each for four months.</p>

<p>The appointment continued for several centuries to be
held by a cleric. In the early days of Parliament, indeed,
the Chancellor received his writ of summons as a Bishop and
not as Chancellor, and, though he attended in the latter
capacity in any case, no summons was sent to him if he did
not happen to be a bishop. Ecclesiastics were appointed to the
Chancellorship, without exception, until the time of Sir Robert
Bourchier in 1340, and it was not for a long time after this
that spiritual statesmen wholly gave place to lawyers. Thomas
à Beckett, William of Wykeham and Cardinal Wolsey, figure
prominently among the clerical Chancellors of early times,
and it was not until the beginning of the seventeenth century
that laymen succeeded in establishing themselves firmly upon
the Woolsack. Since that time no cleric, with the single
exception of Bishop Williams, in 1621, has been entrusted
with the Chancellorship or the custody of the Great Seal.</p>

<p>One of the chief duties of the Chancellor in early times
consisted in affixing the royal Seal with which from time
immemorial the will of the sovereign has been expressed.
At the present day Royal grants and warrants, Letters-Patent
of Peerage or for inventions, Commissions of the
Peace, etc., are issued under what Coke calls the <i>Clavis
Regni</i>. When the sovereign is absent it acts as his representative,
and Parliament itself is opened by a Commission
under the Great Seal. This emblem of sovereignty may
therefore be considered one of the most important instruments
of the Constitution, and, as its loss would entail endless
inconvenience, it is given into the custody of the Lord Keeper
or Lord Chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> As secretary to the King the Chancellor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
would seem to have been its natural custodian, but when he
fell sick or died, or went abroad, it was occasionally placed in
other hands. Later on it became the custom to make the
Keepership of the Great Seal a regular appointment, separate
and distinct from the Lord Chancellorship.</p>

<p>The post of Lord Keeper has been held by statesmen,
courtiers, and divines, and the duties of the office have even
been undertaken on two occasions by women. Queen Eleanor,
the first Lady Keeper, was also the most unpopular. While
her husband was abroad in 1253, and the Great Seal was in
her custody, she made use of her delegated power to lay
a heavy tax on all vessels bearing cargo to London, and
showered gifts of English land and places upon her foreign
relatives. She thus succeeded in arousing the hatred of the
London mob, who expressed their dislike in a material fashion
by pelting her with mud. To avoid the fury of the populace
Queen Eleanor fled abroad, and only returned to England to
take refuge in a convent.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The other Lady Keeper, Queen
Isabella, who held the Great Seal in 1321, had no actual
commission, and was not entrusted with any judicial power.
But she kept the Seal in a casket, and delivered it each day
as it was required to the Master of the Rolls, and may therefore
claim to be included in the list of Keepers.</p>

<p>The post of Lord Keeper and Lord Chancellor first became
identical in Queen Elizabeth's time, when the Great Seal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
entrusted to Sir Nicholas Bacon, who, with his son Sir Francis
and the great Lord Burghley, may be considered the most
eminent of Elizabethan Chancellors. Sir Nicholas has been
called an "archpiece of wit and wisdom",<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and was also well
suited physically to combine the two important offices. By
nature a man of gigantic size, he grew more bulky with
advancing years, and though his dignity was thus increased,
the progress of Chancery business suffered in proportion.
When he took his seat on the bench, after walking from the
Court of Chancery to the Star Chamber, Sir Nicholas always
spent some considerable time in recovering his breath. The
proceedings were accordingly delayed until he had struck the
ground three times with his stick as a signal that he was in a
condition to resume work. As was fitting in a man of his
position, Lord Keeper Bacon inspired intense awe amongst
his subordinates. Indeed, the reverence with which he was
universally regarded eventually proved the indirect cause of
his death. One day, while he was having his hair cut, he
fell into a profound slumber, from which no one had the
courage to rouse him. "I durst not disturb you," said the
barber, when Sir Nicholas at last awoke, chilled to the bone.
"By your civility I lose my life," was the Lord Keeper's reply;
and in a few days his prophecy was fulfilled. Though, with
Sir Nicholas Bacon, the two posts of Keeper and Chancellor
became united, it was not until the time of George III. that
the modern system originated of conferring the Great Seal
and the title of Lord Chancellor simultaneously.</p>

<p>In mediæval days the Chancellorship and the Lord
Keepership were often held in conjunction with other offices.
Stratford was Archbishop of Canterbury as well as Lord
Chancellor in 1334, and, though his ecclesiastical duties were
too onerous to permit of his discharging the functions of the
Lord Keepership, they did not prevent him from retaining to
himself the fees of that office. In 1532, Thomas Audley, the
Speaker of the House of Commons, was appointed Lord
Keeper in succession to Sir Thomas More, and held both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
appointments simultaneously until he was made Lord Chancellor.
And as recently as the reign of Charles II., a Prime
Minister, the Earl of Clarendon, combined the posts of Premier
and Chancellor.</p>

<p>The office of Lord Chancellor developed into one of
primary importance in the time of Edward I., when, from
being but a member of the <i>Aula Regis</i>, he became the president
of a separate court, a Court of Equity. Law and
Equity have, to a certain extent, been antagonistic ever since
the days when kings were advised by clerics and opposed by
lawyers. In the eyes of the latter Equity was often, as
Selden says, "a roguish thing," untrustworthy, and largely
dependent upon the conscience of individual Chancellors, "and
as that is larger or narrower, so is Equity." But however
exaggerated the claim of Equity to be the "law of God,"
"the law of nature," or "law of reason,"<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> it has at least
vindicated its position in the statutory enactment that, where
there is a conflict, its rules are to prevail over those of the
Common Law.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The conscience of some, at least, of England's early Lord
Chancellors possessed peculiarly plastic qualities. They themselves
were not infrequently ignorant of the principles of law.
Occasionally, too, their conduct and character were such that
it is hard to imagine them as the fount of Equity or justice.
Lord Wriothesley, Chancellor in 1544, combined legal incompetence
with the most intense religious bigotry.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Chancellor
Sir Francis Bacon, philosopher, writer, and lawyer, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
name is one of the most famous in English history, was
forced to plead guilty to a charge of "corruption and neglect,"
for which offence he was deprived of the Great Seal, fined a
sum of £40,000, and imprisoned in the Tower. A hundred
years later Lord Chancellor Macclesfield was impeached and
fined for corrupt practices with regard to the sale of Masterships
in Chancery; while the brutal Jeffreys, stained with the
blood of hundreds of innocent and defenceless persons, was
another Lord Chancellor whose presence added nothing to
the prestige of the Woolsack.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Many centuries elapsed before the standard of judicial
morality in England attained its present high level, but even
in the earliest days of the Chancellorship we find occupants
of the Woolsack combining legal wisdom with particularly
blameless lives. The great Sir Thomas More, statesman and
author, was as famous for the extreme simplicity of his habits
as for the ability with which he despatched Chancery business.
The former virtue he almost carried to excess, and his practice
of singing in the choir of the parish church at Chelsea, dressed
in a surplice, surprised and even shocked his contemporaries.
"God's body!" once exclaimed the Duke of Norfolk, seeing
More thus attired and singing lustily; "My Lord Chancellor
a parish clerk! You dishonour the King and his office."
"Nay," replied More, "Your Grace may not think that the
King, your master and mine, will be offended with me for
serving <i>his</i> Master, or thereby account his office dishonoured,"
and he resumed his interrupted hymn.</p>

<p>Jeffreys' predecessor, Lord Guilford, who, as Campbell
tells us, "had as much law as he could contain," was another
Chancellor of blameless morals. In an age when the possession
of a few redeeming vices was considered the mark of a
gentleman, the purity of his conduct caused him some natural
unpopularity. Indeed, his friends strongly advised him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
take a mistress, if he did not wish to lose all interest at Court,
saying that people naturally looked suspiciously at a man
who declined to follow the general practice and seemed to
be continually reprehending them by his superior moral tone.
Lord Guilford's enemies even sought to revenge themselves
upon him by spreading reports calculated to make him look
ridiculous, and once, when the Lord Keeper had gone to the
city to see a rhinoceros which was on view there, circulated a
story to the effect that he had insisted upon riding this animal
down the street. Poor Lord Guilford was much annoyed;
he was blessed with a most exiguous sense of humour, and
could see nothing amusing in so preposterous a suggestion.
"That his friends, intelligent persons, who must know him to
be far from guilty of any childish levity, should believe it,
was what <i>roiled</i> him extremely,"<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> he declared.</p>

<p>The duties of the Lord Chancellor are manifold and of
supreme importance. Lord Lyndhurst, who himself held the
Seal three times, and is famous not only as an orator but also
as the originator of the policy of what is known as the Two
Power Standard,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> once said that the Chancellor's work might
be divided into three classes: "first, the business that is worth
the labour done; second, that which does itself; and third,
that which is not done at all."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>In his Court of Chancery the Lord Chancellor formerly
exercised a vast jurisdiction. At one time all writs were
issued from this Court, and he was not only considered the
guardian of all "children, idiots, and lunatics," but, as Blackstone
says, "had the general superintendance of all charitable
uses in the Kingdom," and was the visitor of all hospitals of
royal foundation.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> His former duties in these respects have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to some extent been delegated to other judges and officers,
acting in his name; the issuing of writs, though also in his
name, has been transferred to the Central Office, and the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery removed to the Chancery
Division of the High Court of Justice.</p>

<p>His judicial position, however, is probably greater than
ever. He is head of the Law and of the Judges&mdash;a vast
though still, perhaps, inadequate number&mdash;President of the
High Court of Justice and of the Court of Appeal, and, above
all, of the highest and final Court of the realm, the House of
Lords. Here he sits continuously, with occasional excursions
to preside over the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
to which come all appeals from India and the Colonies.
As the only legal member of the Cabinet, he is virtually chief
law officer of the Crown, and questions of domestic or international
law are submitted for his advice by his colleagues,
the heads of the other Departments of the Government. In
his capacity of Keeper of the Great Seal he may never leave
the Kingdom, and is <i>ex officio</i> Speaker of the House of Lords,
and must attend all its sittings. The Chancellor does not,
however, enjoy rights similar to those of the Commons'
Speaker; he is not addressed in debate; he does not call
upon peers to speak, and has no authority to settle questions
of order.</p>

<p>As the Woolsack is not considered to be within the limits
of the House of Lords, the fact of a Chancellor being a
Commoner does not prevent him from sitting there and
discharging the duties of Speaker; but he may not take any
other part in the proceedings unless he be himself a peer.
Only in recent times has the Chancellor been necessarily
made a peer, and there exists no statutory restriction incapacitating
any man, unless he be a Roman Catholic, from
holding the office of Lord Chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The limitation of his powers as Speaker of the Lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
owes its origin to the fact that, unlike the Chairman of the
Commons, the Chancellor is always a partisan appointed by
a particular Government, and retires when that Government
goes out of office. As such, he takes an active part in debate,
and, though much respect would be paid to his advice on
points of order, it need never be followed, and he has no
power to decide questions of procedure or to control the
conduct of his fellow peers.</p>

<p>The first Chancellor of an actively partisan character was
Lord Thurlow&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The rugged Thurlow who with sullen scowl,</span>
<span class="i0">In surly mood, at friend or foe will growl"&mdash;</span>
</div>

<p>whose well-known asperity had earned for him the title of
"the Tiger." It was said of him that in the Cabinet he
"opposed everything, proposed nothing, and was ready to
support anything." He was supposed to have derived his
descent from Thurloe, Cromwell's secretary. "There are
two Thurlows in my county," he remarked, when questioned
upon the subject, "Thurloe the secretary and Thurlow the
carrier. I am descended from the carrier."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> His bad
manners on the bench were proverbial, but not apparently
incorrigible. Once at the commencement of the Long Vacation,
when he was quitting the court without taking the usual
leave of the Bar, a young barrister whispered to a companion,
"He might at least have said 'D&mdash;&mdash; you!'" Thurlow overheard
the remark, returned to his place, and politely made
his bow.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Eldon said of Thurlow that he was a sturdy oak
at Westminster, but a willow at St James's, where he long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
figured as the intimate and grateful confidant of George III.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Oft may the statesman in St Stephen's wave,</span>
<span class="i0">Sink in St. James's to an abject slave,"</span>
</div>

<p>but Thurlow's attitude towards his royal master does not
appear to have been marked by extreme servility. Once,
indeed, when the Chancellor had taken some Acts to receive
the royal assent, he read one or two of them through to the
King and then stopped. "It's all d&mdash;&mdash;d nonsense trying to
make you understand this," said Thurlow, with brutal frankness,
"so you had better consent to them at once!" And if
he adopted this tone to his King, it may be certain that his
attitude towards his equals or inferiors was no less overbearing.</p>

<p>Thurlow's character has been cruelly portrayed in the
<i>Rolliad</i> under the heading:</p>


<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">How to Make a Chancellor.</span>"</p>

<p>"Take a man of great abilities, with a heart as black as
his countenance. Let him possess a rough inflexibility, without
the least tincture of generosity or affection, and be as
manly as oaths and ill-manners can make him. He should be
a man who should act politically with all parties&mdash;hating and
deriding every one of the individuals who compose them."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>If the Speaker of the Lords had been expected to conduct
himself in a fashion similar to that of the Speaker of the
Commons, Thurlow's behaviour on the Woolsack would
certainly have given rise to adverse criticism. He was a
frank and bitter partisan, and when some opponent had
spoken, would step forward on to the floor of the House and,
as he himself described it, give his adversary "such a thump
in the bread-basket" that he did not easily recover from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
verbal onslaught.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Thurlow's pet aversion was Lord Loughborough,
his successor on the Woolsack. When Loughborough
spoke effectively upon some subject opposed by
Thurlow, who had not however taken the trouble to study it,
the latter could be heard muttering fiercely to himself. "If I
was not as lazy as a toad at the bottom of a well," he would
say, "I could kick that fellow Loughborough heels over head,
any day of the week." And he was probably right, for Lord
Loughborough was a notoriously bad lawyer,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> whereas his
rival's sagacity almost refuted Fox's celebrated saying that
"Nobody could be as wise as Thurlow <i>looked</i>."</p>

<p>The amount of work accomplished by a Lord Chancellor
depends very largely upon the man himself, as we may see
by comparing the two most distinguished Chancellors of
their day&mdash;Lord Eldon and Lord Brougham.</p>

<p>Eldon had worked his way laboriously from the very foot
to the topmost rung of the legal ladder. It was his own
early experiences that inspired him to say that nothing did a
young lawyer so much good as to be half-starved. And in
action as well as in word he always maintained that the only
road to success at the Bar was "to live like a hermit, and work
like a horse."</p>

<p>He was in many ways an original character. He
always wore his Chancellor's wig in society, and was otherwise
unconventional. One day, after reading much of
"Paradise Lost," he was asked what he thought of Milton's
"Satan." "A d&mdash;&mdash;d fine fellow," he replied; "I hope he
may win." In spite of this view, however, he was an extremely
religious man, though he did not attend divine
service regularly. Indeed, when some one referred to him as
a "pillar of the church," he demurred, saying that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
justly be called a <i>buttress</i> but not a pillar of the church, since
he was never to be found inside it. He is probably the most
typical Tory of the old school that can be found in political
history. His conservatism was of an almost incredibly standstill
and reactionary character. As Walter Bagehot said of
him in a famous passage, he believed in everything which it
is impossible to believe in&mdash;"in the danger of Parliamentary
Reform, the danger of Catholic Emancipation, the danger of
altering the Court of Chancery, the danger of altering the
Courts of Law, the danger of abolishing capital punishment
for trivial thefts, the danger of making landowners pay their
debts, the danger of making anything more, the danger of
making anything less."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Though on political questions Eldon could make up his
mind quickly enough, on the bench the extreme deliberation
with which he gave judicial decisions was the subject of
endless complaints. He agreed with Lord Bacon that "whosoever
is not wiser upon advice than upon the sudden, the
same man is not wiser at fifty than he was at thirty."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> His
perpetual hesitation in Court, the outcome of an intense
desire to be scrupulously just, gave rise to attacks both in
Parliament and the press.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>A Commission was eventually appointed, ostensibly to
inquire into the means by which time and expense might
be saved to suitors in Chancery&mdash;where, as Sydney Smith
said, Lord Eldon "sat heavy on mankind"&mdash;but really to
expose the dilatory methods of the Chancellor. Eldon came
well out of the inquiry, however, and it was proved that in
the twenty-four years during which he had held the Great
Seal, but few of his decisions had been appealed against, and
still fewer reversed.</p>

<p>If some fault could be found with Lord Eldon for being
a slow if steady worker, no such complaint could be levelled
at the head of Lord Brougham. The latter, indeed, erred
on the side of extreme haste, and was as restless on the
bench as Eldon was composed, and as ignorant and careless
of his duties as his predecessor was learned and scrupulous.
Brougham's cleverness, was, however, amazing. If he had
known a little law, as Lord St. Leonards dryly observed,
he would have known a little of everything. He has been
called "the most misinformed man in Europe," and in early
life, when he was one of the original founders of the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, is said to have written a whole number himself,
including articles upon lithotomy and Chinese music.
His ability and brilliance were unsurpassed, and his oratory
was superb. His famous speech (as her Attorney-General)
in defence of Queen Caroline was one of the finest forensic
efforts ever heard in the House of Lords.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> His many talents
have been epitomised in a famous saying of Rogers: "This
morning Solon, Lycurgus, Demosthenes, Archimedes, Sir
Isaac Newton, Lord Chesterfield, and a great many more,
went away in one post-chaise." Yet he was eminently unsuccessful
as Chancellor, and his domineering fashion of treating
his colleagues made him extremely unpopular. Brougham's
loquacity was intolerable, and his conceit immense. "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Whigs are all cyphers," he once declared, "and I am the
only unit in the Cabinet that gives a value to them." It
must, however, be admitted that he was a great statesman
if not a great Chancellor, and that to his unique intellectual
talents we owe in great measure the emancipation of the
negro slave and the passing of the Reform Bill.</p>

<p>In his lifetime, Brougham was almost universally disliked
and feared. "A 'B' outside and a wasp within," said some
wag, pointing to the simple initial on the panel of that
carriage which Brougham invented, and which still bears
his name.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> And this was the popular view of that Chancellor
whom Sheil called "a bully and a buffoon." Even his friends
distrusted him, and in 1835, when Lord Melbourne returned
to power, the Great Seal, which Brougham had held but a
year before, was not returned to him, but was put into Commission.
No reasons were assigned for this step, but they
were sufficiently obvious. "My Lords," said Melbourne in
the Upper House, when Brougham subsequently attacked
him with intense bitterness, "you have heard the eloquent
speech of the noble and learned Lord&mdash;one of the most
eloquent he ever delivered in this House&mdash;and I leave your
Lordships to consider what <i>must be</i> the nature and strength
of the objections which prevent my Government from availing
themselves of the services of such a man!"<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Perhaps one
of the strongest objections was the intense dislike with which
the ex-Chancellor was regarded by the King. This was not
lessened by the cavalier fashion in which Brougham treated
his sovereign. When he was forced to return the Great
Seal into the Royal hands in 1834, he did not deliver it in
person, as was proper, but sent it in a bag by a messenger,
"as a fishmonger," says Lord Campbell, "might have sent
a salmon for the King's dinner!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
A Privy Councillor, by virtue of his office, and "Prolocutor
of the House of Lords by prescription,"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> the Lord High
Chancellor of Great Britain occupies to-day the "oldest and
most dignified of the lay offices of the Crown." By ancient
statute, to kill him is a treasonable offence, and his post as
Lord Keeper is not determined by the demise of the Crown.
He enjoys precedence after the Royal Family and the Archbishop
of Canterbury, holds one of the most prominent places
in the Cabinet, and is the highest paid servant of the Crown.</p>

<p>In Henry I.'s time the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal
was paid 5<i>s.</i> a day, and received a "livery" of provisions, a
pint and a half of claret, one "gross wax-light" and forty
candle-ends. The Chancellor's perquisites used always to
include a liberal supply of wine from the King's vineyards
in Gascony. At the beginning of the nineteenth century,
he received a salary of £19,000; but Lord Eldon, in 1813,
gave up £5000 of this to the Vice-Chancellor, and for a long
time the Woolsack was worth £14,000 a year. A modern
Chancellor's salary is £10,000&mdash;£5000 as Lord Chancellor,
and £5000 as Speaker of the House of Lords&mdash;and he is
further entitled to a pension of half that amount on retirement.</p>

<p>The extensive patronage that attaches to the office adds
much to its importance. The Chancellor recommends the
appointment of all judges of the High Court and Court of
Appeal, and is empowered to appoint or remove County
Court judges and Justices of the Peace. He also has the gift
of all Crown livings of £20 or under, according to the valuation
made in Henry VIII.'s reign, and of many other places.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
One of his perquisites is the Great Seal, which, when "broken
up," becomes the property of the reigning Chancellor. The
breaking up of the Great Seal is a simple ceremony which
inflicts no actual damage upon the article itself. Whenever
a new Great Seal is adopted, at the beginning of a new reign,
on a change of the royal arms, or when the old Seal is worn
out, the sovereign gives the latter a playful tap with a
hammer, and it is then considered to be useless, and becomes
the property of the Lord Chancellor. On the accession
of William IV. a dispute arose between Lord Lyndhurst
and Lord Brougham as to who should possess the old Seal.
The former had been Chancellor when the order was made
for the engraving of the new Seal; the latter had occupied
the Woolsack when the new Seal was finished and ordered
to be put into use. The King, to whom the question was
referred, decided, with truly Solomonian sagacity, that the
Seal should be divided between the two Chancellors.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The people of England, as Disraeli said some seventy
years ago, have been accustomed to recognize in the Lord
Chancellor a man of singular acuteness, of profound learning,
and vast experience, who has won his way to a great position
by the exercise of great qualities, by patient study, and
unwearied industry. They expect to find in him a man who
has obtained the confidence of his profession before he
challenges the confidence of his country, who has secured
eminence in the House of Commons before he has aspired to
superiority in the House of Lords; a man who has expanded
from a great lawyer into a great statesman, and who "brings
to the Woolsack the commanding reputation which has been
gained in the long and laborious years of an admired career."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
Seldom, indeed, are the people of England disappointed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE SPEAKER</h3>


<p>The position of "First Commoner of the Realm" is,
after that of Prime Minister, the most distinguished
as well as the most difficult to which it is possible
for any man to attain while still a member of Parliament.
A comparison of the two offices proves, in one respect at any
rate, favourable to the former; for whereas it has been said
that the Premier "can do nothing right," the Speaker can do
no wrong. He may indeed be considered to enjoy in the
House the prerogative which the sovereign is supposed to
possess in the country. But it is not upon his presumable
infallibility that the occupant of the Chair relies to-day for
the unquestioned honour and dignity of his position. It is
rather to the reputation for absolute integrity with which, for
close upon a hundred years, each Speaker in turn has been
justly credited, that he owes the tribute of esteem and
respect, almost amounting to awe, which is nowadays rightly
regarded as his due. The reverence he now inspires is the
product of many Parliaments; his present state is the gradual
growth of ages.</p>

<p>From very early days, when the two Houses began to sit
apart, the Commons must probably have always possessed an
official who, in some measure, corresponded to the modern
idea of a Speaker. And though Sir Thomas Hungerford,
elected to the Chair in 1377, was the first upon whom that
actual designation was bestowed, the Lower House undoubtedly
employed the services of a spokesman&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
"pourparlour," as he was then called&mdash;at an even earlier
date.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The name "Speaker" is perhaps a misleading one, since
speaking must be numbered among the least important of
the many duties that centre round the Chair, though in
bygone days it was customary for a Speaker to "sum up"
at the close of the proceedings. Grattan's landlady used
to complain feelingly that it was a sad thing to see her
misguided young lodger rehearsing his speeches in his bedroom,
and talking half the night to some one whom he called
"Mr. Speaker," when there was no speaker present but
himself.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> It is, however, as the mouthpiece of the Commons,
as one who speaks for, and not to, his fellow-members, and
was long the only channel through which the Commons could
express their views to the Crown, that the Speaker earns his
title.</p>

<p>The Speaker may well be called the autocrat of the House;
his word there is law, his judgment is unquestioned, his very
presence is evocative of a peculiar deference. He is at the
same time the servant of the House, and, in the memorable
words which Speaker Lenthall addressed to Charles I., has
"neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak but as the House
is pleased to direct." It is upon the good pleasure of the
Commons that his power is based; by their authority alone
he rules supreme.</p>

<p>The prestige which nowadays attaches to the office has
been slowly evolved on parallel lines with the gradual public
recognition of the necessary impartiality of the Chair. In
proportion as the Speaker became fair minded, the strength
of his position was enhanced, until to-day the occupant of the
Chair is as powerful as he is impartial.</p>

<p>That there was a time when he could not justly be accused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of being either the one or the other is a matter of history.
Speakers in the past displayed little of the dignity and none
of the fairness to which their successors have now for so many
generations accustomed us. They were frequently subjected
to intentional disrespect on the part of the unruly members
of that assembly over which it was their duty to preside. In
the early Journals of the House, for instance, we find a
Speaker complaining that a member had "put out his tongue,
and popped his mouth with his finger, in scorn," at him.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
And the worthy Lenthall himself was much upset on one
occasion when a member came softly up behind him, as he
was engaged in putting a question to the vote, and shouted
"Baugh!" in his ear, "to his great terror and affrightment."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
Even as recently as in the reign of George III. the parliamentary
debates were marked by perpetual altercations of an
undignified and acrimonious description between the members
and the Chair.</p>

<p>That such things would be impossible nowadays is the
result not so much of an improvement in the manners of the
House&mdash;though that may have something to do with it&mdash;as
in the complete change which has taken place in the character
of its Chairman.</p>

<p>Up to the end of the seventeenth century the Chair was
to all intents and purposes in the gift of the Crown: its
occupant was a mere creature of the reigning sovereign. "It
is true," wrote Sir Edward Coke, in 1648, "that the Commons
are to chuse their Speaker, but seeing that after their choice
the king may refuse him, for avoiding of expense of time and
contestation, the use is that the king doth name a discreet
and learned man whom the Commons elect."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The Speaker
was, indeed, nothing more nor less than the parliamentary
representative of the King, from whom he received salaried
office and other material marks of the royal favour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
In Stuart days the Commons had grown so jealous of the
influence of the Crown, and found the Speaker's spying
presence so distasteful, that they often referred important
measures to Giant Committees of which they could themselves
elect less partial chairmen. That they were justified in their
fears is beyond doubt. In 1629, for example, Speaker Finch,
who was a paid servant of King Charles, declined to put to
the House a certain question of which he had reason to
believe that His Majesty disapproved. Again and again he
was urged to do his duty, but tremblingly refused, saying
that he dared not disobey the King. On being still further
pressed, the timorous Finch burst into tears, and would have
left the Chair had not some of the younger and more hotheaded
members seized and held him forcibly in his seat,
declaring that he should remain there until it pleased the
House to rise.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Even in the days of the Commonwealth, the choice of
a Chairman was not left entirely to the independent will
of the Commons, and Lenthall, himself the first Speaker
to treat the Crown with open defiance, owed his election to
the urgent recommendation of Cromwell.</p>

<p>The Chair did not altogether succeed in clearing itself of
Court influence until the close of the seventeenth century,
when the memorable and decisive conflict between the Crown
and the Commons took place over the Speakership. The
refusal of Charles II., in 1678-9, to approve of Sir Edward
Seymour, the Commons' choice, aroused the most intense
resentment in the breast of every member of the House, and
was the subject of many heated debates. Though the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
assembly had eventually to bow to the royal will, the election
of the King's original candidate was not pressed, and the
Commons may be said to have gained a moral victory. From
that day to this no sovereign has interfered in the election of
a Speaker, nor since then has the Chair ever been filled by a
royal nominee.</p>

<p>As a result of this great constitutional struggle between
King and Parliament, the Speaker gained complete independence
of the royal will, but he had still to acquire that
independence of Party to which he did not practically attain
until after the Reform Act of 1832.</p>

<p>From being the creature of the Crown, the Speaker
developed into the slave of the Ministry, thus merely exchanging
one form of servitude for another. He was an active
partisan, and, in some instances, openly amenable to corruption.
Sir John Trevor, the first Speaker to whom was given
(by a statute of William III.) the title of "first Commoner of
the realm," an able but unscrupulous man who began life
in humble circumstances as a lawyer's clerk, was actually
found guilty of receiving bribes, and forced to pronounce his
own sentence. "Resolved," he read from the Chair on
March 12, 1695, "that Sir John Trevor, Speaker of this House,
for receiving a gratuity of 1000 guineas from the City of
London, after the passing of the Orphans Bill, is guilty of a
high crime and misdemeanour." This resolution was carried
unanimously, and on the following day, when Sir John should
have been in his place to put to the vote the question of his
own expulsion, he wisely feigned sickness, and was never
more seen within the precincts of the House.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Arthur Onslow, who was elected to the Chair in 1727, and
filled it with distinction for three and thirty years, has been
called "the greatest Speaker of the century," and was the
first to realise the absolute necessity for impartiality. So
determined was he to ensure himself against any possible
suspicion of bias that he insisted upon sacrificing that portion
of his official salary which was customarily paid by the
Government.</p>

<p>Excellent though such an example must have been, it
was many years after Onslow's retirement before his successors
ceased to display a partisan spirit wholly incompatible
with the dignity of their office. Speaker Grenville threatened
to leave the Chair because the Ministry of the day refused
to accelerate the promotion of a military relative of his;
Addington frequently overlooked trifling breaches of the
rules of procedure committed by his political chief and crony,
Pitt; Abbot contrived that the scheme for the threatened
impeachment of Lord Wellesley should prove abortive. It
was the last-named Speaker, however, who unwittingly brought
to a head the question of the impartiality of the Chair, and
thereby settled it once and for all.</p>

<p>On July 22, 1813, at the prorogation of Parliament,
Speaker Abbot took it upon himself to deliver at the bar of
the House of Lords a lengthy party harangue on the subject
of Catholic emancipation. This frank exposition of his
private political views roused the indignation of the Commons,
who took an early opportunity of expressing their disapproval
of his conduct. Not even his friends could condone
Abbot's action, and in April of the following year a resolution
was moved in the Commons gravely censuring him for
his behaviour on this occasion. For several hours he was
forced to listen to criticisms and abuse from both sides of the
House, and though, as a matter of policy, the resolution was
not carried, the Commons in the course of this debate proved
beyond doubt their determination to secure the impartiality
of their Chairman.</p>

</div>

<p>That they succeeded in accomplishing their purpose may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
be gauged from the conduct and character of Abbot's successors.
So divorced from all political prejudice is the
modern Speaker, that he does not deem it consistent with his
position to enter the portals of any political club of which he
may happen to be a member. Even at a General Election
he steers as widely clear of politics as possible. It is not,
indeed, usual for his candidature to be opposed at such a
time&mdash;though an exception was made as recently as 1895,
when Speaker Gully was forced to contest Carlisle&mdash;and
though he may appeal in writing to his constituents, he
is not supposed to touch, in his election address, upon any
political questions.</p>

<p>The duties of a Speaker may be summarized in a few
words. As the representative of the House he alone of the
Commons is privileged to communicate direct with the Crown,
either as the personal bearer of an address, or at the bar of
the House of Lords when the sovereign is present.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> As the
mouthpiece of the House he delivers on its behalf addresses
of thanks to whomever Parliament delights to honour; he
censures those who have incurred its displeasure. In his
hands lies the issuing of writs to fill parliamentary vacancies;
he alone can summon witnesses or prisoners to the bar of
the House, or commit to prison those persons who have
offended against its privileges. His powers have been
greatly increased of late years by the discretion committed
to him under various Standing Orders of accepting or
refusing motions for the closure of debate. It is, besides,
a part of the daily routine of the Chair to put questions to
the vote, to declare the decision of the House, and, finally,
to maintain order in debate.</p>

<p>Successfully to accomplish the last-named duty is a
matter that requires all that a man has of tact, strength of
character, and promptness of judgment. It is, above all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
things, necessary that by his personal integrity he should
gain the confidence of the House, so that a willing acquiescence,
and not a reluctant submission, may be given to the
force of his decisions. He must, as Sir Robert Peel declared,
have a mind capable of taking the widest view of political
events, but at the same time able "to descend to the discussion
of some insulated principle, to the investigation of
some trifling point of order, some almost obsolete form, or
some nearly forgotten privilege."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Ever ready to quell turbulence with a firm hand, he must
yet display an habitual urbanity of manner calculated to
soothe the nerves of an irritable or excited assembly. He
must make up his mind calmly and dispassionately, but on
the spur of the moment, and, once his judgment is formed,
adhere to it inflexibly. Difficult questions arise for his
decision with startling rapidity; intricate points of order
loom suddenly forth from a clear sky; and any show of
vacillation would tend very materially to weaken the Speaker's
authority.</p>

<p>When a member uses unparliamentary language, or makes
a personal attack upon an opponent, the Speaker must
summon his most persuasive powers to induce the culprit to
withdraw the offensive words. At a moment's notice he has
to decide a matter between two eminent debaters, who would
be little likely to consult him on any private occasion, and
give satisfaction to both. To a perpetual serenity, as a member
once said in describing the Speaker's office, he must add
"a firmness of mind as may enable him to repress petulance
and subdue contumacy, and support the orders of the House,
in whatever contrariety of counsels, or commotion of debate,
against all attempts at infraction or deviation."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>To sum up, then, it may be urged that a Speaker should
combine intellectual ability with those qualities of character
which are the mark of what is called a "gentleman"&mdash;a term
that has, perhaps, seldom been more aptly defined than in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
speech in which Lord John Cavendish recommended the
claims of a candidate to fill the chair vacated by the death of
Sir John Cust in 1770.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>The physical qualifications necessary for the Speakership
include a clear, resonant voice and a commanding presence.
A little man with a flute-like falsetto might be endowed with
the wisdom of Solomon and the virtue of Cæsar's wife, and
yet fail to claim the respect of the House, even though he
contrived to render audible his shrill cries of "Order!"
When Sergeant Yelverton was elected to the Chair in 1597,
he declared that a Speaker ought to be "a man big and
comely, stately and well spoken, his voice great, his carriage
majestical, his nature haughty, and his purse plentiful,"<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and,
with the omission of the last qualification, now no longer
necessary, the same may truly be said to-day.</p>

<p>The enjoyment of perfect health might also be added to
this list, since only the most robust constitution can support
the strain of labours which were always arduous, and, with the
rapid increase of business and the prolongation of each succeeding
session, grow annually more onerous.</p>

<p>Hour after hour does the Speaker sit in the splendid
isolation of the Chair, listening to interminable speeches, of
which no small proportion are insupportably wearisome.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Like sad Prometheus, fastened to his rock,</span>
<span class="i0">In vain he looks for pity to the clock;</span>
<span class="i0">While, vulture-like, the dire [M.P.] appears,</span>

</div>

<p>He may not rest, though the cooing of Ministers on the
immemorial front bench, and the murmur of innumerable
M.P.'s, must often threaten to reduce the hapless listener to a
condition bordering upon coma. He must pay the strictest
attention to every pearl that falls from the lips of "honourable
gentlemen," many of whom delight to air their vocabulary
at an unconscionable length, and, like Dryden's Shadwell,
"never deviate into sense." He must be ever ready to check
irrelevancy, to avert personalities, to guide some discursive
speaker back to the point at issue; nor is he upheld by the
stimulus of interest which might possibly be his could he look
forward to replying to the member who is addressing the
House.</p>

<p>For the last hundred years it has been considered undignified
for the Speaker to take any personal part in debate,
even when the House is in Committee, though Speaker
Denison once broke this rule, and made a long speech upon
some agricultural question. Speaker Abbot often spoke in
Committee, and once actually moved an amendment to a
Bill which had been read a second time, and succeeded in
getting it thrown out. At a still earlier date, in 1780, we
read of Sir Fletcher Norton inveighing vehemently against
the influence of the Crown, and making a violent attack upon
Lord North which resulted in what Walpole calls "a strange
scene of Billingsgate between the Speaker and the Minister."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
But though Speaker Norton, who was reputed to be the
worst-tempered man in the House, could thus relieve his
pent-up feelings in occasional bursts of eloquence, he took no
pains to conceal his boredom, and during the course of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
particularly tedious debate would often cry aloud, "I am
tired! I am weary! I am heartily sick of all this!"<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
Speaker Denison, even, on one occasion, at the end of a protracted
session, grew so anxious for release that when a
tiresome orator rose to continue the debate he could not
refrain from joining in the members' general chorus of
"Oh! oh!"</p>

<p>As a rule, however, modern Speakers seem able to
exercise complete self-control, and, bored though they must
often be, are polite enough to hide the fact. They cannot now
have recourse to that flowing bowl of porter which Speaker
Cornwall kept by the side of the Chair, from which he drank
whenever he felt the need of a mental fillip, subsequently
falling into a pleasing torpor which the babble of debate did
nothing to dispel. To-day, indeed, the Speaker neither
slumbers nor sleeps, and the advice given by the poet Praed
to the occupant of the Chair during one of the debates of the
first reformed Parliament would fall on deaf ears.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>It is very necessary for the proper performance of his
duties that a Speaker should possess good eyesight, and a
memory exceptionally retentive of names and faces. In
1640, when a heated dispute rose between members of the
House, several of whom claimed precedence of speech, a
rule was made that whoever first "caught the Speaker's eye"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
should have the right to address the House.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> This rule still
holds good. Much confusion may therefore arise if the
Speaker happens to suffer from obliquity of vision. Sir John
Trevor squinted abominably; consequently two members
would often catch his eye simultaneously, and decline to give
way to one another.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> To obviate this, a further rule was
framed to the effect that the Speaker should call by name
upon the member privileged to address the House&mdash;a rule
which must often prove a severe tax upon a Speaker's
memory.</p>

<p>In former days, when there was any doubt as to who
should speak, the matter was referred to the House, as is
still the practice of the House of Lords. Nowadays it is
settled by the Speaker. It is the usual practice of the Chair
to fix an alternate eye upon either side of the House, and
thus provide both parties with equal opportunities of speech.</p>

<p>The tension of this perpetual strain upon a Speaker's
nerves is not altogether relieved when he quits the Chair.
As long as the House is sitting it is obligatory upon him to
remain within the precincts of the building, close at hand,
lest the proceedings in Committee of the whole House come
to an end, and the House be resumed, or in case a sudden
emergency should arise to demand his immediate presence.
And well it is that this should be so. Who that was present
on that painful occasion in the summer of 1893, when for
once the decencies of debate were violated, and the House
degenerated into a bear-garden, can have forgotten the effect
of Mr. Speaker Peel's sudden advent upon the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain had drawn a comparison between Herod
and Mr. Gladstone. A Nationalist member retaliated by
shouting "Judas!" at the member for West Birmingham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
In vain did a weak Chairman seek to restore order, and when
a Radical member crossed the floor and sat down in the
accustomed seat of the Leader of the Opposition, he was at
once pushed on to the floor by an indignant Unionist. This
was the signal for an impulsive group of Nationalists to
detach itself from the main body of the Irish party, and rush
towards the front Opposition bench. In a moment the
House was in an uproar. It is not known who struck the
first blow, but before many moments had elapsed the floor of
the Commons was the arena of a hand-to-hand struggle
between hysterical politicians of all parties, while from the
Government bench Mr. Gladstone watched this tumultuous
scene with all the bitter emotions of one to whom the honour
of the House was especially dear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Speaker had been sent for, and in an
incredibly short space of time appeared upon the scene. With
his advent hostilities ceased as suddenly as they had begun.
The storm died away; passion quailed before "the silent
splendid anger of his eyes." In the breasts in which but a
moment ago fury had been seething there was now room for
no feelings save those of shame.</p>

<p>The authority of the Chair is no doubt enhanced by the
distinctive dress which a modern Speaker wears. The flowing
wig and full robes have an important use. Mankind pays
an involuntary homage to the pomp and circumstance of such
attire. Perhaps it was because Lenthall possessed no peculiar
costume to distinguish him from his fellows, but wore the
short grey cloak and peaked hat of the Puritan, that he was
subjected to the humiliation of having "Baugh!" shouted in
his astonished ear. Indeed, were a modern Speaker dressed "in
smart buckskin breeches, with well-topped boots, a buff waistcoat
and blue frock-coat, with a rosebud stuck in the buttonhole,"
as a Parliamentary writer of the last century suggested,
"he might roar to the crack of his voice before he would be
able to command order in a tempestuous debate."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>During the first four centuries of Parliament the Speaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
received no regular salary adequate to his needs. In 1673,
Sir Edward Seymour was paid £5 a day, and relied for the
remainder of his income upon the fees on private bills which
accompanied the office. Other Speakers in the past were
remunerated by the gift of Government appointments or sinecures
conferred upon them by the Crown. This casual system
was put a stop to in 1790, when a fixed salary was first paid
by the House to its chief officer.</p>

<p>For the next fifty years the Speaker could also claim
valuable perquisites in the shape of equipment money, amounting
to £1000, at the commencement of each new Parliament,
a service of plate (valued at about the same sum), and a
sessional allowance of £100 for stationery. He was also permitted
to carry the Chair away with him at the end of every
Parliament, and Speaker Onslow is said to have thus acquired
five of these bulky pieces of furniture, the disposal of which
in his private residence must have afforded him a perplexing
problem.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>The Speaker also received a gift of wine and a Christmas
present of broadcloth from the Clothworkers' Company; and,
as a buck and doe were sent to him annually from the Royal
Park at Windsor, had probably more opportunities of burying
venison than any of his contemporaries. The £1000 equipment
money is still provided, and a service of plate, while an
adequate supply of stationery is substituted for the allowance.</p>

<p>As "First Commoner" the Speaker takes precedence of
all others, and among his many honorary dignities is the
Trusteeship of the British Museum, to which all Speakers,
since and including Arthur Onslow, have been appointed.
His present salary amounts to £5000 a year, and he is also
provided with an official residence in the Palace of Westminster,
exempt from the payment of all rates and taxes.</p>

<p>Out of this income he is expected to entertain, and invitations
to the "Speaker's Dinners" have come to be looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
upon as one of the minor delights of membership. During
the eighteenth century the Speaker was in the habit of giving
evening parties and official dinners on the Saturdays and
Sundays of the session.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Speaker Abbot, in his Diary,
describes one of these dinners at which twenty guests were
entertained. "The style of the dinner was soup at the top
and bottom, changed for fish, and afterwards changed for
roast saddle of mutton and roast loin of veal." The wine
was champagne, Hock, Hermitage, and (which sounds unpleasant)
iced Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> His successors have always continued
the practice of holding regular weekly entertainments
of a social character, at which the members attend in <i>levée</i>
dress, and it is doubtful whether any guest to-day would
follow the example of Cobbett, who declined an invitation to
dine with Speaker Manners Sutton on the grounds that he
was "not accustomed to the society of gentlemen."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>In old days, as we have seen, the Speakership was often
a stepping-stone to some higher appointment. Sir Thomas
More, "the first English gentleman who signalized himself as
an orator; the first writer of prose (as Townsend calls him)
which is still intelligible"<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>&mdash;whatever that may mean&mdash;was
also the first lay Chancellor of England. It was not considered
strange for the Speaker to hold some ministerial
appointment both while he sat in the Chair and after his
retirement. Sir Edward Coke was Solicitor-General as well as
Speaker; Harley occupied the office of Secretary of State
and the Chair simultaneously. Spencer Compton was Paymaster-General
as well as Speaker, and, as Lord Wilmington,
became Prime Minister in 1742. Nor was he the only
Speaker to exchange the Chair for the Premiership. Addington
succeeded Pitt in that office in 1801; Grenville became
Prime Minister in the Government of "All the Talents,"
five years later; and Manners Sutton is said to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
urged by the Duke of Wellington to form a Ministry in
1831-2.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Nowadays, when a Speaker finally relinquishes the Chair,
it would be considered derogatory to his dignity for him to
reappear in the House as a simple member of Parliament.
Addington did so, but soon realized the difficulty of his
position, and requested that he might be elevated to the
House of Lords.</p>

<p>It has long been the custom for the Commons to ask the
Crown to recognize in a material fashion the services of a
retiring Speaker. He is allowed a pension of £4000 a year,
and, ever since the retirement of Abbot in 1817, a peerage of
the rank of a viscountcy has been conferred upon him.</p>

<p>Placed in a position of extraordinary trust, hedged about
with the lofty traditions of his office, weighed down by
heavy responsibilities, engaged in a sedentary occupation
during the greater part of the day or night, a Speaker may
well agree with that candid correspondent who, in congratulating
Addington on his elevation to the Chair in 1789,
referred to the Speakership as "one of the most awful posts
I know."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>In the long list of those who have so ably guided and
controlled the proceedings of the House of Commons during
the last hundred years, many names stand forth conspicuously&mdash;Manners
Sutton, Shaw Lefevre, Denison, Brand, Peel.
No Speaker has ever fallen short of the trust reposed in him,
or failed in his duty to the House, and it may confidently
be asserted that so long as the standard of English political
life maintains its present high level, no difficulty will ever be
experienced in providing the Chair with an occupant who
shall fill it, not only worthily, but with distinction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT</h3>


<p>Parliament, like everything else, must have a beginning.
The opening of a session which is also the
commencement of a new Parliament is an event which
tradition invests with all the accompaniments of what Cobden
contemptuously referred to as "barbaric pomp." The inaugural
rites are performed with a stately ceremonial of which
Selden himself would have approved<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>; everything is done to
make the pageant as impressive as possible.</p>

<p>The actual business of the opening may be described as
extending over several days, the climax being reached when
the sovereign arrives in person to deliver his speech.</p>

<p>The opening itself is nowadays performed by a Commission
issued for that purpose under the Great Seal. On the day
appointed by royal proclamation for the meeting of a new
Parliament, the Houses assemble in their respective chambers.
Before doing so, however, special precautions have been taken
to ensure the safety of our legislators. A picturesque
procession, composed of Yeomen of the Guard in their
striking uniforms, makes its way through the numerous
subterranean vaults of the Palace of Westminster, seeking
diligently for the handiwork of some modern Guy Fawkes.
This now familiar search is an ancient custom kept up more
in accordance with popular sentiment than for any practical
reason. The duties of the Beefeaters have no doubt already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
been anticipated by the police, but though the fruitlessness
of their quest is now a matter of regular recurrence, they
persistently refuse to be discouraged, and the search is
prosecuted with renewed hopefulness at the commencement
of every session.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, the Lord Chancellor,
preceded by the Mace and Purse, and attended by his Train
Bearer, enters the House of Lords by the Bar. He is dressed
in his robes, and when he has taken his seat, places his
cocked hat upon his head. Four other Lords Commissioners,
similarly attired, are seated beside him on a bench situated
between the Woolsack and the Throne. From this point of
vantage the Chancellor summons the Gentleman Usher of
the Black Rod, and commands him to inform the Commons
that their immediate attendance is desired in the House of
Lords to hear the Commission read.</p>

<p>The post of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod dates
from the reign of Henry VIII. By the constitution creating
the Order of the Garter, he was to be an officer "whom the
Sovereign and Companions will shall be a gentleman famous
in Arms and Blood, and live within the Dominions of the
Sovereign, and, for the dignity and honour of the Order, shall
be chief of all Ushers of this Kingdom, and have the care
and custody of the doors of the High Court called Parliament."
Black Rod, either personally or through his deputy, the
Yeoman Usher, fulfils in the House of Lords the functions
which are performed in the Lower House by the Sergeant-at-Arms
of the Commons. As custodian of the doors of Parliament,
he once had the right to appoint all the doorkeepers
and messengers of the House of Lords, as well as his
assistant, the Yeoman Usher. He used in old days to sell
these appointments for large sums, and as his fees brought him
in a substantial income&mdash;in 1875 they amounted to £5300&mdash;and
he was also provided with an official residence, his post
was one to be coveted. The system of paying officials by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
fees was, however, abolished in 1877, and Black Rod's annual
salary was fixed at £2000, which to-day has been reduced by
half, while his residence has been taken from him and given
to the Clerk of the Parliaments.</p>

<p>On receipt of the Lord Chancellor's command, Black Rod
at once obeys&mdash;he is usually a retired naval or military officer
and the spirit of discipline is still strong within him&mdash;and
repairs to the Lower House to deliver his message.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a busy scene is being enacted in the House of
Commons. From the earliest hours before the dawn members
have been gradually assembling at Westminster. At the
gates of Palace Yard a respectful crowd collects to watch the
arrival of the nation's lawmakers. Motor-cars, carriages, and
the more humble public conveyances flow in a ceaseless
stream through the Commons' gates. The traffic at the
corner of Whitehall is perpetually held up to allow some
member to cross the street in safety, much to the annoyance
of travellers who desire to catch a train at Waterloo Station.
Smiling police constables salute the old familiar faces, carefully
scrutinizing the new ones for future reference.</p>

<p>The House within presents something of the appearance
of a school on the first day of a new term. The old boys
welcome each other effusively, exchanging holiday reminiscences;
the new boys wander timidly about the precincts,
seeking to increase their topographical knowledge. Friend
greets friend with all the warmth engendered by separation;
colleagues describe their own, and inquire tenderly after
one another's ailments. Even the bitterest opponents may
be seen congratulating each other on re-election, or exchanging
accounts of their individual experiences during the recess.
An atmosphere of peace and goodwill pervades the whole
House.</p>

<p>All is bustle and confusion in the Chamber itself, where
members hasten to secure places on the green benches upon
either side of the Speaker's Chair. By the rules of the House
no member has a right to reserve a seat unless he has been
present within the precincts during prayers, and has staked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
out his claim either with a hat or a card provided for the
purpose. The hat used on this occasion must be a member's
own "real working hat." He may not arrive with two hats,
one to wear and the other to employ as a seat-preserver; nor
is he permitted to borrow the headgear of a friend who has
already secured a seat. A story is told of some wily member
appearing at Westminster, on the morning of an important
debate, in a four-wheeler brimming over with hats which he
proposed to distribute upon the benches in order to retain
places for his party. Such conduct, however, though ingenious,
is strictly contrary to regulations, and could scarcely hope
to escape the vigilant eye of the Sergeant-at-Arms.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">THE TREASURY BENCH IN 1863<br />

FROM AN ENGRAVING AFTER THE PAINTING BY J. PHILIP</span>
</div>

<p>Certain privileges are accorded to members who by reason
of their distinguished position, or long service in the House,
have acquired a claim to particular seats. The two front
benches on either side have long been reserved for the more
prominent politicians. On the right of the Chair is the
Treasury Bench, where Ministers sit; while the front seat
facing them is occupied by the leading members of the
Opposition. It has been customary for Privy Councillors
to sit on these two benches, and at the opening of Parliament
the members for the City of London may claim a similar
privilege.</p>

<p>The right of Cabinet Ministers to occupy front seats,
now undisputed, was sometimes questioned in olden days.
In 1601, as the outcome of complaints on this subject, Robert
Cecil, then Secretary of State, offered to give up his place
most willingly to any member who wished to sit near the
Chair. "We that sit here," he said, "take your favours
out of courtesy, not out of right."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Courtesy, has, indeed,
generally been displayed by members on this particular
question, though there have been occasional exceptions.
That rough diamond, Cobbett, who was frequently complaining
of the lack of space in the House, occupied Sir
Robert Peel's accustomed seat one day, as a protest against
the insufficient accommodation of the Chamber. No notice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
however, was taken of his conduct, and his rude but legitimate
methods have never since been emulated.</p>

<p>A member who has been honoured by a parliamentary
vote of thanks, or has grown grey in the service of the
House, is usually allowed to retain his seat.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Hume, who
attended every single debate during the period of his membership,
for years occupied the same bench close to one of the
pillars supporting the gallery above the Speaker's Chair.
"There is Joseph," remarked a wag who was not above
making a pun, "always at his <i>post</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Otherwise members may sit wherever they please, provided
they have qualified by presence at prayers. Certain positions
in the House have, however, come to be regarded as symbolical
of the political views of their occupants. Supporters of the
Government sit on the right and those of the Opposition on
the left of the chair. The aisle or passage that divides the
House transversely has always acted as a sort of political
boundary, and members who are independent of either party
proclaim their freedom by sitting "below the gangway."
Here on the Opposition side the Irish party has sat for many
years; here, too, the Labour members mostly congregate.</p>

<p>On the opening day the Speaker's Chair is, of course,
vacant, and the mace reposes peacefully underneath the
table. The duties of Chairman are undertaken by the Clerk
of the House, who sits in his usual place, and presides in
dumb show over the proceedings.</p>

<p>The clerkship of the House of Commons is an important
post, and has been in the hands of many capable and distinguished
men. Among the famous lawyers who have held
this office may be instanced Elsynge&mdash;ridiculed in Hudibras
as "Cler: Parl: Don: Com:"<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>&mdash;Hatsell, Erskine May, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Palgrave, all of whom have made valuable literary contributions
to the annals of parliamentary history.</p>

<p>The post has also been temporarily filled by persons of
considerably less eminence. In 1601, for example, Fulk
Onslow, who was then clerk, was permitted to appoint his
servant, one Cadwallader Tydder, to act as his deputy.
Again, in 1620, the clerk being incapacitated by illness,
his son was allowed to take his place, and it was advised
that a lawyer should sit beside him "with a hat upon his
head" to assist the youth in his unaccustomed <i>rôle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> It is
the Clerk's duty to record the proceedings, edit the Journals,
and sign any orders issued by the House. Up to the year
1649, when he was given an annual salary of £500, his income
consisted of £10 a year (paid half-yearly!) and certain fees
on private bills. A collection, amounting to about £25,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> to
which all members were expected to contribute sums varying
from 5<i>s.</i> to £1, was also made for him at the close of the
session. This sounds a paltry sum, but Hatsell is said
to have made £10,000 a year while Clerk of the House,
among his other perquisites being a <i>douceur</i> of £300, which
the Clerk Assistant paid to his chief for the privilege of
appointment. In those days the Clerk could also earn
small sums by copying Bills or making extracts from the
Journals of the House for members, who paid him at the
rate of ten lines a penny, though if they declared upon oath
that they were unable to pay this sum, no charge was made
for the work.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of the messenger from the House of Lords is
heralded in the lobbies by loud cries of "Black Rod!" The
door of the House of Commons is flung open, and the Gentleman
Usher, in full uniform and decorations, and bearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
wand of his office in his hand, advances in a stately fashion
up the floor of the House and delivers his message. He
then retires backwards as gracefully as possible until he
reaches the Bar, where he awaits the arrival of the Clerk.
The two now walk together, attended by as many members
as care to accompany them, to the Bar of the House of
Lords, where the Lords Commissioners are awaiting their
advent.</p>

<p>As soon as the Commons' contingent appears, the Lord
Chancellor orders the reading of the Letters Patent constituting
the Commission for the opening of Parliament, and when
this task has been performed by the Reading Clerk of the
House of Lords, desires the faithful Commons to retire and
choose a Speaker. With this purpose in view the members
return forthwith to the Lower House.</p>

<p>The election of a Speaker is the most important part of
the day's business, for without it the House of Commons
cannot be constituted, nor can members be permitted to take
the oath.</p>

<p>Theoretically a Speaker leaves the Chair with the Parliament
that elected him. Practically, nowadays, he is retained
in office. He is reappointed with the usual ceremonies at the
beginning of every Parliament, and it is rare for an incoming
Ministry to supplant the occupant of the Chair, even though he
may have been the nominee of political opponents. Manners
Sutton was six times Speaker, Arthur Onslow five times,
while Shaw Lefevre, Denison, and Peel each occupied the
Chair in four successive Parliaments. Since their day an
unwise and abortive attempt was made to replace Speaker
Gully by a Conservative nominee in 1895, but it is unlikely
that such an incident will recur.</p>

<p>The motion for a Speaker's election is made by a member
on the Government side of the House, and usually seconded
by a member of the Opposition, both being called upon to
speak by the Clerk who silently points his finger at each in turn.
If it is intended to contest the election, the two candidates
put forward are proposed and seconded separately by members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of their own party. The question that the Government candidate
"do take the Chair of this House as Speaker" is first
put by the Clerk, and divided upon in the ordinary way. If
a majority of the House is in favour of the election of this
candidate, no further division is necessary. If not, the same
proceeding is carried out with regard to the second candidate.
In such cases it has been the custom for each nominee to
vote for his opponent. The division is naturally one of
intense interest. Perhaps the most exciting elections of a
Speaker that have ever occurred were those that took place
in 1835 and 1895. On the first occasion Abercrombie was
elected to replace Manners Sutton, by the narrow margin of
ten,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and in 1895 Speaker Gully's majority only exceeded
this by a single vote.</p>

<p>"When it appeareth who is chosen," says Elsynge, "after
a good pause he standeth up, and showeth what abilities are
required in the Speaker, and that there are divers amongst
them well furnished with such qualities, etc., disableth himself
and prayeth a new choice to be made. After which two go
unto him in the place where he sits and take him by the arms,
and lead him to the chair."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> In old days it was customary
for the Speaker-Elect to "disable" himself at great length
and in the humblest possible terms. Christopher Wray, in
1570, spoke for two hours in this self-deprecatory style.
Sergeant Yelverton, twenty-six years later, explained his
unfitness for the post in a lengthy harangue in which he
remarked that if "Demosthenes, being so learned and
eloquent as he was, one whom none surpassed, trembled
to speak before Phocion at Athens, how much more shall I,
being unlearned and unskilful, supply this place of dignity,
charge, and trouble to speak before so many Phocions as
here be?"<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Other Speakers put forward "a sudden disease,"
"extreme youth," or some similar disability as their excuse
for escaping from the service of the Chair. Even as late as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the beginning of the eighteenth century Sir Spencer Compton
thought it necessary to declare to the Commons that he had
"neither the memory to retain, the judgment to collect, nor
the skill to guide their debates."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>This excessive humility on the part of a Speaker-Elect
has now disappeared, together with the ridiculous old custom
whereby it was considered correct for him to evince actual
physical reluctance to take the Chair. It was once deemed
proper for the newly elected Speaker to refuse to occupy the
exalted throne that awaited him until his two supporters had
seized him by the arms and dragged him like some unwilling
victim to the scaffold. To-day, he "goes quietly," as the
police say; the proposer and seconder lead him gently by
the hand, and he gives his attendants no trouble at all.</p>

<p>After the Speaker has taken the Chair, the mace is laid
upon the table before him, the leaders of either Party offer
their congratulations, and the business of the day is over.</p>

<p>When Parliament meets once more, on the following afternoon,
the Chancellor and his four fellow Lords Commissioners,
attired as before, in their robes, resume their seats upon the
bench in the House of Lords, and Black Rod is again commanded
to summon the Commons. This time his task is not
so simple. When the messenger from the Lords arrives at
the door of the House of Commons, he finds it barred against
him, nor is it opened until he has knocked thrice upon it and
craved permission to enter. This custom of refusing instant
admittance to the Lords' official dates from those early times
when messages from the Crown were regarded by the jealous
Commons with feelings bordering on abhorrence.</p>

<p>The Speaker-Elect, clad in his official dress, but without
his robe, and wearing upon his head a small bob-wig in place
of that luxuriant full-bottomed affair which he is so soon to
don, has already taken his seat in the Chair, making three
profound obeisances to that article of furniture as he advances
towards it.</p>

<p>When Black Rod has delivered his message, the Speaker-Elect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
surrounded by his official retinue, proceeds at once to
the House of Lords. Here he is politely received by the
Lords Commissioners, who raise their hats three times in
acknowledgment of his three obeisances. After acquainting
the Lords Commissioners of his recent election, he humbly
submits himself to the royal approbation. The Lord Chancellor
thereupon expresses His Majesty's approval of the
Commons' choice, and the election of the Speaker is confirmed.
In former days the sovereign was in the habit
of undertaking this duty in person. On January 27, 1562,
Queen Elizabeth came to Westminster in her state barge,
"apparelled in her mantles open furred with ermine and in
her Kyrtle of crimson velvet closed before, and close sleeves,
but the hands turned up with ermine. A hood hanging
loose round about her neck of ermine. Over all a rich collar
set with stones and other jewels, and on her head a rich call."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
Thus attired, she proceeded to give the royal assent to the
election of the Speaker. This nowadays is a mere formality&mdash;it
has indeed only once been refused, in 1678, when Charles
II. declined to sanction the election of Sir Edward Seymour&mdash;and
is given by the Lords Commissioners on the sovereign's
behalf.</p>

<p>In the days when the sovereign was in the habit of being
present in the House of Lords to ratify the choice of Speaker,
the latter would often excuse himself to his monarch in terms
even more abject than he had used in the Lower House.
Before the election of Sir Richard Waldegrave, in 1381,
Speakers did not excuse themselves at all, and until Henry
VIII.'s time they do not seem to have done so as a matter of
etiquette, but merely from personal motives, wishing to
ingratiate themselves with the sovereign in whose pay they
were and to whom they looked for advancement. But towards
the middle of the sixteenth century they began regularly to
address the king in a fulsome fashion.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> In 1537, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
we find Speaker Rich grovelling in abject prostration at the
royal feet, and comparing the King to Solomon, Samson,
Absalom, and most of the other heroes of Old Testament
history. Even among the Speakers of that day, however,
there were men who refused to demean themselves to this
form of flattery, and Queen Elizabeth was once forced to
listen patiently while Richard Onslow, who declared himself
to be "a plain speaker, fit for the plain matter, and to use
plain words," delivered to Her Majesty an "excellent oration,"
which lasted for two solid hours.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>This practice is fortunately extinct, but one other custom
of Henry VIII.'s time still obtains. To-day the Speaker, on
receipt of the royal approbation, takes the opportunity of at
once demanding the "ancient and undoubted rights and privileges
of the Commons"&mdash;freedom from arrest, liberty of speech,
access to the royal person, and that a favourable construction
be put upon their proceedings&mdash;and on his own behalf begs
that whatever error may occur in the discharge of his duties
shall be imputed to him alone, and not to His Majesty's
faithful Commons.</p>

<p>These ancient rights and privileges having been confirmed
by the King, through his Lords Commissioners and by the
mouth of his Lord Chancellor, the Speaker withdraws to the
Lower House. There he acquaints the Commons of the result
of his recent pilgrimage, and gratefully assures them once
more of his complete devotion to their service. After retiring
for a few moments to make the necessary alterations in his
costume, he returns, clad in his robe and wearing his full-bottomed
wig, and is now a complete and perfect Speaker.</p>

<p>While this is going on, the Upper House has temporarily
adjourned to unrobe, and afterwards resumes to enable the
Lords to continue taking the Oath, which is meanwhile being
administered to the Commons.</p>

<p>Prior to the sixteenth century, members of Parliament
were not required to swear; the Lords did not do so until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
1678. But the Act of Supremacy of 1563 made it necessary
for all members of the Commons to take the oath, and in
1610 were introduced further oaths of Allegiance and Abjuration
which were maintained until 1829. The old oaths aimed
at excluding Roman Catholics from Parliament, and the
regulation which in 1614 ordered every member to take
the sacrament in St. Margaret's Church on the Opening Day
was but another means of ensuring the religious loyalty of
the Commons.</p>

<p>Members of the Lower House cannot take the oath until
their Speaker has been approved and sworn; the Lords may
do so as soon as Parliament opens. In the Upper House the
oath may be taken at any convenient time when the House is
sitting; in the House of Commons likewise it may be taken
whenever a full House is sitting at any hour before business
has begun.</p>

<p>The Lord Chancellor leads the way in the House of
Lords. When he has presented his writ of summons,
repeated the formal words of the Oath of Allegiance after
the Clerk, kissed the New Testament, and subscribed to the
Test Roll, he resumes his seat on the Woolsack. The peers
then succeed one another in rapid rotation at the table,
handing their writs of summons to the Clerk, and following
the Chancellor's example.</p>

<p>In the Commons the Speaker first takes the oath in a
very similar fashion, and writes his name in the Roll of
Members. After this ceremony is accomplished, members
come up to the table in batches of five, and are sworn simultaneously.
They then shake hands with the Speaker, and
can now consider themselves full-fledged members of
Parliament.</p>

<p>Up to the middle of the last century three oaths had to
be taken by every member of either House: the oaths of
Allegiance, of Supremacy, and Abjuration. There was further
a declaration against transubstantiation which effectually
excluded Roman Catholics. But in 1829 these last received
relief, though the final words of the Oath of Abjuration still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
kept out the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In 1849 Baron Lionel de Rothschild was
excluded from the Commons because of his failure to swear
on "the true faith of a Christian." He accepted the Chiltern
Hundreds, but was again returned to Parliament by the City
of London. And though he once more failed to obtain permission
to vote in the House, he was allowed to sit there until
1857.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Six years before this latter date another Jew, Alderman
Salomons, insisted upon taking his seat and voting in a
division. He was forcibly ejected by the Sergeant-at-Arms,
and subsequently fined £500 in the Exchequer Court as a
penalty for voting without having previously taken the oath.
In 1858 an Act was passed substituting a single oath for the
former three, and giving both Houses power to deal with the
Jewish difficulty by resolution, but it was not until 1866 that
the words referring to Christianity were finally omitted from
the oath.</p>

<p>The refusal of Quakers and atheists to take the oath disturbed
for many years the peace of mind of Parliament, and
was the subject of frequent legislation. In 1832 the Quaker
Pease was elected for a Durham division, and claimed the
right of affirming instead of taking the oath. A Committee
was appointed to consider the validity of such an affirmation,
and came to the conclusion that this form might be substituted
harmlessly for the more usual oath.</p>

<p>The case of the atheist Bradlaugh, which lasted for nearly
ten years, was a much more complicated affair, and presented
endless difficulties to the parliamentary mind.</p>

<p>We have grown more broad-minded during the last fifty
years, and the story of Bradlaugh's persecution sounds incredible
to modern ears. This unfortunate man was hounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and harassed with a degree of intolerance which was almost
mediæval in its ferocity. Politicians of every grade combined
to insult and bait him; he became the butt of Parliament,
and evoked from men who had hitherto shown but little zeal
in their faith a religious ardour of the most fanatical and
bigoted description.</p>

<p>Bradlaugh was returned to Parliament as member for
Northampton in 1880. As an atheist it was against his
principles to swear upon the Bible. When, therefore, he presented
himself in the House of Commons with the intention
of taking his seat, he asked to be allowed to affirm instead of
taking the oath. The fact of his being entirely devoid of any
religious beliefs or scruples rendered an affirmation in the
form usual in Parliament practically valueless. His request
was accordingly refused, and when he declined to withdraw
from the House, he was committed to the custody of the
Sergeant-at-Arms.</p>

<p>Many members of the House of Commons were determined
to prevent such a man from taking his seat, and for
a long time its doors remained closed against him. Lord
Randolph Churchill made a violent attack upon him on
the 24th of May, in the course of which he read an extract
from Bradlaugh's book, "The Impeachment of the House of
Brunswick," hurling the offensive volume on the floor and
trampling it underfoot. The House of Commons has always
disliked anything that borders upon melodrama, and this
action, more suited to the boards of the Adelphi than to
the stage of Parliament, fell as flat as Burke's famous
dagger.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> But the spirit that prompted it was the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
one, and it long seemed impossible for an atheist to sit in
the House.</p>

<p>On July 1, Gladstone moved a resolution allowing
members who could not conscientiously take the oath to
affirm, subject to any legal liabilities they might incur, and
on the following day Bradlaugh made the necessary affirmation.
The affair did not end here, however. The legal
authorities had been stirred up to investigate the judicial
aspect of the case, and decided that a man of Bradlaugh's
opinions was by law disqualified from affirming. He thus
lost his seat, but was promptly re-elected. Whereupon the
House of Commons carried a resolution that he be not
permitted to go through the form of repeating the words of
the Oath, which, as far as Bradlaugh was concerned, was an
absolutely meaningless formality, and, in the opinion of
many, an act of sheer blasphemy.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>When Bradlaugh next attempted to take his seat, a
further resolution was carried excluding him altogether from
the House. He refused, however, to acquiesce in this view
of the situation, and, after giving due notice of his intention
to the Speaker, forced his way into the House, whence he
was removed with some difficulty by the Sergeant-at-Arms
and police.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>For a short time he remained quiet, and then suddenly,
in 1882, he reappeared in the House of Commons, walked
alone to the Table, administered the oath to himself, and
claimed the right to sit. Upon a motion of Sir Stafford
Northcote he was once more expelled, and once more the
electors of Northampton returned him as their representative.</p>

<p>During the two following years Bradlaugh brought actions
against the Sergeant-at-Arms and his deputy, and tried to
induce a court of law to restrain these officials from carrying
out the orders of the House. His efforts, however, were
vain, the courts deciding that the Commons had a perfect
right to control their own internal affairs.</p>

<p>In 1884 he again entered the House and took the oath.
He was again excluded from the precincts, applied for the
Chiltern Hundreds, and was again returned for Northampton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had voted in several divisions, and the
Attorney-General, on behalf of the Crown, brought an action
against him to recover three separate sums of £500, as
penalties for having voted without previously taking the
oath.</p>

<p>For two more years the conflict continued to rage round
the burly figure of this remarkable man. By 1886, however,
the Commons had grown weary of this ceaseless and senseless
persecution, and Bradlaugh was at last permitted to take
his seat; and in 1888 an Act was passed extending the right
to affirm to those who state that they have no religious
belief.</p>

<p>Parliament thus gradually came to take a broader view
of the situation, and during Bradlaugh's absence, in 1891,
the House of Commons passed a resolution expunging from
the Journals the original motion whereby he was prevented
from affirming. Thus ended a long controversy, in the
course of which the much-harassed victim had behaved
with exemplary self-control, only once showing signs of
annoyance, when the rough handling to which he was subjected
by the police resulted in the breakage of a favourite
stylographic pen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>This taking of the oath or making an affirmation at the
commencement of a new Parliament is the only introduction
necessary for a member who has been elected during the
recess, or of a peer who has succeeded to a title.</p>

<p>The introduction of a newly created peer, or of one who
has been elevated to higher rank, is a ceremony that strikes
the spectator as quaint or impressive, according as he has or
has not a sense of humour. Attired in his robes, and supported
by two other peers of his own degree, who act as his sponsors,
the new peer walks slowly up the floor of the House of Lords,
preceded by a procession of State officers&mdash;Black Rod, Garter
King-at-Arms, the Hereditary Earl Marshal of England, and
the Lord Great Chamberlain, in full dress.</p>

<p>On reaching the Woolsack the neophyte falls upon one
knee and presents to the Lord Chancellor, and receives back
from him, his patent of peerage and his writ of summons,
both of which are read aloud by the Reading Clerk. The
new peer then takes the oath and signs the roll, and is led
by his supporters and the officers of State on a ceremonial
pilgrimage round the Chamber to the bench on which he is
by rank entitled to sit. Here the three peers in their scarlet
robes seat themselves. They are, however, only allowed a
few moments' rest, and at a pre-concerted signal the trio rise
together and lift their hats in unison to the Chancellor, who
responds in similar fashion. Three times this gesture is
repeated, after which the original procession is reformed, and
the new peer retires, shaking hands with the Chancellor on
his way.</p>

<p>Much the same procedure is followed in the case of bishops,
though spiritual peers are not preceded by the Great Officers,
nor have they any patent to present. Representative peers
of Scotland or Ireland are not introduced in this formal
manner, but merely take the oath and sign the roll.</p>

<p>The introduction of a member of the House of Commons,
elected in the course of the session, is a somewhat similar but
less formal affair. Accompanied by two other members of
Parliament he advances up the floor of the House, "making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
his obeisances as he goes up, that he may be better known
to the House," and frequently evoking cheers from the party
to which he belongs.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> He may take the oath at any time,
if the Clerk of the House has received the certificate of his
return. In 1875 Dr. Kenealy, whose methods of conducting
the defence of the notorious Tichborne claimant had alienated
the respect of most right-thinking men, was unable to persuade
any member to introduce him in the House of Commons.
At last, out of sheer kindness of heart, John Bright declared
that he would accompany the unpopular member. He was
not called upon to do so, however, the rule being in this
instance dispensed with, at Disraeli's suggestion, and Kenealy
walked alone to the Table.</p>

<p>The swearing in of peers and members occupies several
days, and by the time this task is accomplished Parliament is
ready to listen to the King's Speech, with which every new
session is opened.</p>

<p>This final ceremony is a State function of the most
picturesque and spectacular description. The road leading
from Buckingham Palace to Westminster is lined with troops;
flags fly from all the public buildings; the pavements and
windows along the route are packed with sightseers. In the
famous glass coach, drawn by the fat cream ponies so dear
to the heart of every loyal subject, the King and Queen drive
in State to the House of Lords. Here they are met by the
Lord Chancellor, Purse in hand, while the Great Officers of
State form a long procession through the Royal Gallery, and
precede their Majesties into the Gilded Chamber.</p>

<p>The House presents a magnificent spectacle. Every
bench is crowded with peers in their scarlet and ermine
robes. At their sides sit the peeresses in evening dress,
adorned, according to custom, with feathers and veils, while
the Woolsacks in the centre of the House are occupied
by the Judges arrayed in their judicial finery, and in a box
at one side are the Ambassadors and Ministers of Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Powers.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The galleries are filled with specially privileged
visitors of both sexes, and, as the royal procession enters,
the whole assembly rises to its feet and remains standing
until their Majesties have reached the two thrones at one
end of the Chamber.</p>

<p>On taking his place upon the throne, the King bids the
peers to be seated, and, through the Lord Great Chamberlain,
commands Black Rod to inform the Commons that it is His
Majesty's pleasure that they attend him immediately in the
House of Lords.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The delivery of this royal message to the Commons is
the signal for a stampede of members towards the Upper
House; grave politicians vieing with one another in the
endeavour to be first at the Bar of the Lords. O'Connell
compared the rush of members on such occasions to that of
a pack of boys released from school, scrimmaging together
to get out of the class-room. In their haste to arrive at the
goal, the Commons are apt to hurry the unhappy Speaker
before them like the sacrificial ox, urged along reluctant to
the horns of the altar.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The rude incursion of the Commons
once provoked the Yeoman of the Guard, who kept the
doors of the Lords, to shut it in their faces. "Goodmen
burgesses," said the Sergeant of the Guard, in 1604, "ye come
not here!" much to the Commons' indignation.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Members
have often had their clothes torn in the confusion and tumult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of this rush, and one at least has suffered a dislocated
shoulder. Sir Augustus Clifford, who was Black Rod in
1832, lost his hat and was physically injured in a <i>melée</i> on
the opening day. In 1901, the first opening of Parliament
by the sovereign in a new reign, after a long discontinuance
of the ceremony, and the number of new members after a
general election, combined to make the occasion exceptional.
In spite of the employment of eighty extra police,
engaged to keep the way clear for the Speaker's procession,
several persons were badly hurt, owing to the overpowering
rush of members struggling to secure the limited number
of places available below the Bar of the Lords, and many
policemen lost their helmets in the struggle.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>Headed by their Speaker, then, the Commons surge into
the Upper Chamber, and stand at the Bar, awaiting the
reading of the King's Speech.</p>

<p>The anxiety of the Commons to gain good places from
which to listen to the Speech is all the greater nowadays, since
it has ceased to be customary to publish it beforehand. In
Walpole's time the Government used to meet at the Cockpit
in Whitehall on the eve of the opening to consider the royal
speech.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> This practice came to an end with the eighteenth
century, but the Speech was still made public property by
being sent to the papers on the evening of the Ministerial
and Opposition dinners which precede the opening of
Parliament. It is still read aloud by the official hosts at
these banquets, but does not appear in the Press on the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
morning, and the contents of the Speech are not made
public until it is read by the King (or the Lords Commissioners)
at the Opening of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> In 1756 a spurious
speech was published and circulated, just before the opening,
much to the annoyance of the authorities. King George,
however, took a lenient view of this outrage. He even
expressed a hope that the printers might not be too severely
punished. He had read both speeches carefully, he said, and,
as far as he could understand either, infinitely preferred the
spurious one to his own.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>The King's Speech is not usually a very remarkable
production, either from a literary or any other point of view,
though many of those for which Gladstone, Disraeli, or
Lord Salisbury were responsible were exceptionally lucid
and well written. Macaulay has described it as "that most
unmeaningly evasive of human compositions." As a rule,
it exudes platitudes at every paragraph; its phraseology is
florid without being particularly informing. "Did I deliver the
Speech well?" George III. inquired of the Lord Chancellor,
after the opening of Parliament. "Very well, Sire," was
Lord Eldon's reply. "I am glad of it," answered the King,
"for there was nothing in it!"<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> If speech was given us to
conceal thought, the King's Speech may often be said to
fulfil its mission as a cloak to drape the mind of the Ministry.
Lord Randolph Churchill once declared that the Cabinet had
spent some fifteen hours eliminating from it anything that
might possibly have any meaning. From the ambiguous
suggestions it contains, the public is left to infer the exact
form of legislation foreshadowed. The King's Speech is
popularly supposed to be written by His Majesty himself.
But though approved by him, it is composed by the Prime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Minister and the Cabinet, of which probably each member
contributes the paragraphs referring to his own department.
It expresses, therefore, the Government's rather than the
sovereign's views.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria discontinued the reading of her Speech
after the death of the Prince Consort, delegating this duty to
the Lord Chancellor. Other monarchs, however, have usually
been their own spokesmen on this occasion&mdash;sometimes at
great personal inconvenience. William IV., in his old age,
found much difficulty in reading his Speech, one gloomy
winter's afternoon. The light in the Upper House was so
poor that he could scarcely decipher a word, and he was
forced to refer perpetually for assistance to Lord Melbourne.
At last two wax tapers were brought, and the King, quietly
remarking that the Speech had not received the treatment
that it deserved, proceeded to read it right through again
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Another royal personage treated the Speech with far less
respect. George IV., when Prince Regent, is said to have
bet Sheridan a hundred guineas that he would introduce the
words "Baa, baa, black Sheep!" into the King's Speech without
arousing comment or surprise. He won his bet, and
afterwards, when Sheridan asked Canning whether he did
not think it extraordinary that no one should have noticed
so strange an interpolation: "Did you not hear His Royal
Highness say, 'Baa, baa, black sheep'?" he asked. "Yes,"
replied Canning; "but as he was looking straight in your
direction at the moment, I deemed it merely a personal
allusion, and thought no more about it!"</p>

<p>After the delivery of the King's Speech, His Majesty
and the other members of the Royal Family retire from the
Chamber, and the Commons return to their own House.
Here the Speaker "reports" or reads the Speech once more.
In the House of Lords the Chancellor is undertaking a
similar duty, standing in his place at the Woolsack. Lords
and Commons remain uncovered while the Speech is being
read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Before this happens, however, a Bill <i>pro formâ</i> is read a
first time in both Houses, on the motion of the two Leaders,
as a sign that Parliament has a right to deal with any matter
in priority to those referred to in the King's Speech.</p>

<p>When this formality has been carried out and the Speech
read, an Address of thanks to the King is moved by two
members of each House. The motion for the Address is proposed
and seconded by some rising young politicians selected
by the Government, who are thus given an opportunity of
displaying their oratorical prowess, and a debate ensues.
The debate on the Address originated in Edward III.'s reign,
and sometimes lasted two or three days. It was the regular
preliminary of Parliamentary deliberations. To-day in the
Commons it occasionally extends over a whole fortnight, or
even longer.</p>

<p>After the Address has been agreed to, and ordered to be
presented to His Majesty, both Houses proceed to make
various arrangements for the conduct of their internal affairs,
committees of different kinds are appointed, and other preparations
made for facilitating the labours of the Legislature.</p>

<p>Parliament is now open, and the serious business of the
Session begins.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>RULES OF DEBATE</h3>


<p>"It is true," says Bacon, "that what is settled by custom,
though it be not good, at least is fit. It were good,
therefore, that men in their innovations would follow the
example of time itself, which, indeed, innovateth greatly, but
quietly." Parliament has certainly acted upon this advice,
and nowhere is the steady and silent legislation by precedent
more conspicuous than in the forms which govern the procedure
of both Houses. Occasional practices have become
usages, growing with the growth of Parliament, adapting
themselves imperceptibly to the circumstances which at once
created and required them, "slowly broadening down from
precedent to precedent," like that national freedom of which
the poet sings.</p>

<p>Parliament has kept as close as possible to the wings of
Time, and, as Plunket said, has watched its progress and
accommodated its motions to their flight, varying the forms
and aspects of its institutions to reflect their varying aspects
and forms. For if this were not the spirit that animated
Parliament, "history would be no better than an old
almanack."<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> In spite of this, however, the maxim which
Sir Edward Coke declared to be written on the walls of the
House of Commons, that old ways are the safest and surest
ways, still prevails, and it is not often that any parliamentarian
has the courage to say, as Phillips said to Coke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
on a memorable occasion, "If there be no precedent for this,
<i>it is time to make one</i>."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>The machine of a free constitution, as Burke declared, is
no simple thing, but as intricate and delicate as it is valuable;
and to keep that machine in good working order, to make
the wheels run smoothly, it has been found necessary to frame
a code of procedure which has its roots in the traditions and
precedents of the parliamentary history of the past. For
hundreds of years any attempt to alter the ancient procedure
was looked upon as a kind of sacrilege. It was not until the
Speakership of Shaw Lefevre that any serious changes were
made in the business methods of Parliament, and Rules and
Standing Orders devised to expedite business and reduce
waste of time to a minimum.</p>

<p>The maintenance of order and the acceleration of business
have always been the main objects sought for, for which
provision is now made in the Standing Orders of both Houses.
These have been revised and their number increased from
time to time, no fewer than twenty-one committees having
been appointed between the years 1832 and 1881, for the
sole purpose of improving the procedure of the House of
Commons.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The most important, perhaps, are those which refer to
speaking in debates&mdash;the chief duty of those who take any
part in the deliberations of Parliament.</p>

<p>Speeches in either House must be delivered in English
and <i>extempore</i>, the speaker standing uncovered above the bar.
Formerly, when the House of Commons was in Committee,
members could speak sitting, and nowadays invalid members
are usually allowed this privilege. Even these, however
must obey the rule as to being bareheaded. The only occasion
on which a member may&mdash;and indeed must&mdash;speak sitting
and covered is during a division when a question of order
arises upon which he wishes to address the House. Gladstone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
who never wore his hat in the House, once provoked loud
cries of "Order!" by forgetting this last rule. Realising
his mistake, he hastily borrowed the headgear of a friend.
Being, however, blessed with an unusually large head, his
appearance in a hat several sizes too small for him caused
much amusement.</p>

<p>Peers and members occasionally wear their hats while
sitting in their respective Houses, as a protection from the
glaring light or from the extraordinary draughts caused by
the modern system of ventilation; but they invariably uncover
to move about from one place to another. They also
momentarily remove their hats when the Chancellor or
Speaker enters, or when a message from the Crown is read.
It is customary, too, to uncover as a sign of respect when
a vote of thanks is proposed or an obituary speech made in
memory of a deceased statesman. There is an instance in
Stuart days of a member expressing his disapproval of a vote
of thanks by clasping his hands upon the crown of his hat
and cramming it down over his eyes, but this has never been
repeated.</p>

<p>The Quaker Pease was always disinclined to comply with
the rule that members should walk about the House uncovered.
A doorkeeper was therefore instructed to remove
this member's hat quietly as he entered, and keep it safely
hidden until he wished to leave. After a time, Pease became
accustomed to doing this for himself, and the doorkeeper was
relieved of his duty.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Disraeli, like Gladstone, sat bareheaded in the House of
Commons, but kept his hat under his seat ready for an
emergency. It was then the general custom of members to
wear their hats in the House, but fashions have changed, and
Cabinet Ministers to-day generally leave their head-gear in
the private rooms with which they are now accommodated,
while humbler legislators make use of the hat-pegs provided
for the purpose in the entrance hall of both Houses.</p>

<p>In the Commons, as we have already noted, the member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
who first catches the Speaker's eye has the prior claim to
speak. In the Lords a different rule obtains. Should two
peers rise simultaneously, one usually gives way to the other.
Otherwise the House decides, if necessary by a division,
which of the two is to address it.</p>

<p>In the House of Lords peers address their fellows; in the
Commons members are bidden to direct their remarks to the
Speaker, or in Committee to the Chairman. This practice
dates from the old days when the Speaker was the mouthpiece
of the House and it was very necessary for members to
make clear to him the exact nature of their grievances or
petitions, so that he might transfer them correctly to the
Crown.</p>

<p>In the Commons the rules prescribe that no reference to
previous debates of the same Session shall be made, unless
these were upon the subject now under discussion. It is
likewise "out of order" to read from a newspaper or book
any printed speech made within the same Session. No
allusion is allowed to speeches made in the other Chamber,
the idea being that debates are secret and unknown. This
rule, however, is neatly evaded by the simple process of
referring to "another place," a euphemism under which
members of either House can disguise their allusions to the
proceedings of the other.</p>

<p>Seditious or treasonable words are sternly forbidden in
Parliament, as is also the use of the sovereign's name to
influence debates. No member may commit contempt of
court by referring to matters that are <i>sub judice</i>, nor may he
insult the character or proceedings of either House, or use his
right of speech for the purpose of obstructing public business
in his own.</p>

<p>In May, 1610, "a member speaking, and his Speech
seeming impertinent, and there being much Hissing and
Spitting. It was conceived for a Rule, that <i>Mr. Speaker may
stay Impertinent Speeches</i>."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Thirty years later an order of
the House was framed, whereby, "If any touch another by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
nipping or irreverent speech, the Speaker may admonish
him. If he range in evil words, then to interrupt him,
saying: 'I pray you to spare those words.'"<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Nowadays
debate must be relevant to the matter before the House, and
the Speaker may not only call upon an impertinent or
irrelevant member to cease speaking, but may even use his
discretion as to refusing to propose to the House a motion
which he considers to be of a purely obstructive character.</p>

<p>Disorderly conduct in Parliament was punishable by fine
in 1640, when Strode, ever a stickler for parliamentary
decorum, moved that "every one coming into the House who
did not take his place, or did, after taking his place, talk so
loud as to interrupt the business of the House from being
heard, should pay a shilling fine, to be divided between the
sergeant and the poor."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Since Strode's day a number of further regulations have
been added to the code of parliamentary procedure, but the
Speaker's task of keeping order is facilitated by the desire on
the part of every member to uphold the authority of the
Chair. This expresses itself in the courtesy with which that
piece of furniture, or rather, its occupant, is treated. Whenever
a member of the House of Commons passes the Chair
he accords it a slight bow, and this rule is never willingly
infringed. He bows to it when he enters the chamber, and
again when he leaves, and is always particularly careful not
to intercept his person between it and the speaker who
happens to be addressing the House. In the Upper House,
the Woolsack is treated with similar deference, no lord
knowingly passing between it and any other lord who is
speaking, or between it and the table. There being no
Speaker authorized to keep order in the Lords, when "heat
is engendered in debate," it is open to any peer to move that
an ancient Standing Order referring to asperity of speech be
read by the Clerk.</p>

<span class="caption">THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN 1910</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Whether or not language be "parliamentary" is always
a matter difficult to determine. In the House of Commons
it is left entirely to the discretion of the Chair. Lord
Melbourne remembered a Speaker ruling it out of order to
refer to any one as "a member of the Opposition."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Even
the familiar "Hear! hear!"&mdash;the modern version of "Hear
him!" which was the sign of approbation in the days of Pitt&mdash;has
been ruled to be disorderly, if uttered in an offensive
manner. Major O'Gorman was "named" by Speaker Brand
for insisting that he had the right to shout "Hear! hear!"
after every word, every semi-colon, and every comma of a
member's speech. In 1887, Speaker Peel called the attention
of the House to the fact that "Shame!" was an unparliamentary
expression, and rebuked an Irish member for
continuously shouting "Order! Order!" in a disorderly
manner.</p>

<p>Any epithet which reflects upon the character of a
member of either House, or upon the conduct of the King
or of others in high places, is considered to be disorderly,
though notice is not always taken of it. In 1672, on the
first day that Lord Shaftesbury took his seat as Lord
Chancellor, the Duke of York called him a rascal and a
villain. "I am much obliged to your Royal Highness for
not calling me likewise a coward and a Papist," was the
Chancellor's urbane reply. When Feargus O'Connor, in
1848, denying the charge of Republicanism that had been
brought against him, said that he didn't care whether the
Queen or the devil sat on the Throne, what threatened to
develop into a disagreeable incident was averted by the
pleasantries of the Prime Minister. "When the honourable
gentleman sees the sovereign of his choice on the throne
of these realms," said Peel, "I hope he will enjoy, and I feel
sure he will deserve, the confidence of the Crown!"</p>

<p>Matters were not always so easily smoothed over. In
1675, during the debate on the Address, Coke was committed
to the Tower for remarking, "I hope we are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Englishmen, and are not to be frightened out of our duty
by a few high words"&mdash;an observation which was considered
to cast a reflection upon James II. In 1823 Canning
stigmatized as "false" a statement of Brougham's, and for
a long time refused to withdraw the offensive expression.
The worthy Plimsoll was carried away by feelings of
righteous indignation in 1875, and referred to certain shipowners,
who were also members of the House, as "villains."
It was not until a week later that he could be induced to
apologise. O'Connell called Lord Alvanley a "bloated
buffoon," and declared Disraeli to be the lineal descendant of
the impenitent thief on the Cross.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Disraeli himself, in 1846,
likened Lord John Russell to a vulture, and Mr. Biggar was
termed an "impudent scoundrel" by a fellow-member in
1881. Nine years later Dr. Tanner referred to Mr. Matthews,
the Home Secretary, as "one of the basest and meanest
skunks that ever sat upon that bench"; and among the
titles which have been freely conferred upon Mr. Chamberlain
by his enemies, "Judas" and "d&mdash;&mdash;d liar" are by no means
the most opprobrious. Such language, however, is mercifully
rare, and no modern Prime Minister could say, as Lord North
did to the alderman who presented a petition from the
electors of Billingsgate, that the honourable gentleman spoke
not only the sentiments, but even the very language of his
constituents.</p>

<p>A member may not speak at all unless a question is before
the House, or he intends to conclude with a motion or
amendment; but an exception is made in favour of a personal
explanation, or of a question of privilege suddenly arising,
which commands precedence over all other business.
Questions also may be addressed to Ministers before public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
business commences, and the latter may make statements of
public interest.</p>

<p>Save when the House is in Committee, a member or peer
is not allowed to speak twice upon the same question, unless
on a point of order, or to explain some unintelligible portion
of a first speech. If, however, he has moved a substantive
motion, he has a right of reply at the end of the debate.
Once when Lord North was speaking, a dog ran barking
into the House. "Mr. Speaker," said the Prime Minister, "I
am interrupted by a new member!" The dog was eventually
driven out with some difficulty, but shortly afterwards re-entered
by another door, when it began barking as loudly as
ever. Lord North remarked dryly that the new member had
spoken once already, and was consequently violating the
rules of the House.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>In the House of Lords peers speak of one another by
name, but in the Commons it is the custom to refer to
colleagues by their constituencies, as "the Honourable (or
Right Hon.) gentleman, the member for Hull (or West
Birmingham, etc.)." The title "honourable" is always used
in conjunction with a member's name, but should be reinforced
by the epithet "gallant" or "learned" in the case of a naval
(or military) member, or of a lawyer.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>It was not until after the Reform Act of 1832 that the
practice of referring to members by their constituencies
came into fashion. In Stuart days it was not customary
to mention either the names or the constituencies of members.
They were simply referred to as "the gentleman on the other
side of the way," "the member that last spake," etc. Nowadays
it is usual to talk of a member, if on the same side of
the House, as "my honourable friend"; and if on the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
side, as "the honourable gentleman (or member)." But
opponents sometimes publicly include one another within
the sacred circle of honourable friendship, though politically
they may be the bitterest enemies.</p>

<p>There is no rule of procedure regulating the length of
speeches in either House. A man may speak for as long
as he likes, the only limit being set by his own powers of
endurance or the patience of his audience; but his remarks
must be relevant. "If any speak too long, and speak
<i>within the matter</i>, he may not be cut off; but if he be
long, and <i>out of the matter</i>, then may the Speaker gently
admonish him of the shortness of the time, or the business
of the House, and pray him to make as short he may."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
As a matter of practice his fellow-members will probably
have admonished him of the shortness of the time long before
by shouting "'Vide! 'Vide!" until he brings his speech to
a welcome close.</p>

<p>The determination to proceed in spite of this hint that
his efforts are unappreciated only increases the uproar,
for, as Burke once said, the House of Commons has an
intense dislike for anything resembling obstinacy.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> A
Khedive of Egypt, who visited the House of Commons at
the beginning of the nineteenth century, and listened with
surprise to the deafening noise made by a political audience,
came to the conclusion that the shouting of "'Vide!" was the
ordinary English mode of expressing intense boredom. On his
return to Egypt he suffered much from the protracted interviews
which he was compelled to grant to Sir John Bowring,
a prosy talker, who had been sent to Cairo in 1837 on a
commercial mission. The Khedive's patience finally became
exhausted, and one day, while Sir John was as usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
addressing him at unconscionable length, His Highness began
exclaiming "'Vide! 'Vide! 'Vide!" and continued doing
so until his visitor was reduced to silence.</p>

<p>The words of Speaker Spencer Compton have often been
quoted to show that members are acting within their rights
in preventing the delivery of a speech; that, as Bright said,
the House can employ noise "as a remedy" against a dull
or prolix speaker. A member appealed to Compton to
restore order, urging that he had a right to be heard. "No,
sir," replied the Speaker, "you have a right to speak, but the
House has a right to judge whether they will hear you!"
This, according to so great an authority as Hatsell, was
an altogether wrong decision, the Speaker's chief duty being
to keep the House attentive and quiet.</p>

<p>In the House of Lords, where there is no Speaker to
curtail a lengthy or irrelevant speech, any peer may propose
that the noble lord who is on his legs "be no longer heard"&mdash;a
disagreeable but effective way of informing a bore of his
prolixity.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> This method was unsuccessfully tried in the
Commons in 1880. O'Donnell had put down a question
asking whether M. Challemel Lacour, the prospective French
Ambassador at the Court of St. James's, had, "as one of the
Prefects of the Provisional Government of September 4, 1870,
ordered the massacre of Colonel Latour's battalion, and had
been fined £3000 by a Court of Justice for plundering a convent."
Gladstone moved that the honourable member "be
no longer heard;" but the Speaker, on being appealed to,
stated that this was an unusual course, which had certainly
not been adopted for at least two hundred years. A "scene"
ensued, and finally O'Donnell was induced to put down the
question again for a later date. Before this day arrived, however,
the Speaker tactfully managed to suppress the question
altogether, as being "beyond the cognisance of the House or
the Queen's Government."</p>

<p>Occasional efforts have been made to stem the flow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
parliamentary eloquence in the Commons, but without much
success. The late Sir Carne Rasch tried for years to shorten
speeches, but in vain. Mr. Hogan sought to introduce the
New Zealand scheme, whereby the Speaker rings a bell when
any member has spoken for twenty minutes; but though
Mr. Balfour declared that twenty minutes erred on the side of
generosity, nothing came of this suggestion. In spite of a
good deal of unnecessary talking, the House of Commons
gets through a lot of work, though there is no doubt that,
as Bright said, more business could be done if so much time
were not wasted in unprofitable eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Dr. Johnson,
visiting a musical family of his acquaintance, suggested that
they should all perform together. "There will then," he
explained, "be more noise, but it will be sooner over."
Similar suggestions have been made with regard to the House
of Commons, but the question of stifling parliamentary
loquacity remains unsolved.</p>

<p>When such loquacity was deliberately employed to delay
business, obstruction took various forms, of which the favourite
one a few years ago consisted of motions to adjourn the debate
or adjourn the House. Sheridan once made this motion nineteen
successive times, until members were so tired of tramping
through the lobbies that they gave in and went home.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> In
1831, on July 12th, the opponents of the Reform Bill saw
that their only hope lay in retarding the business of the
House. They set about to force a division on repeated
motions for adjournment, and it was not until 7.30 a.m. of
the following day that the Commons at length adjourned.
Sir Charles Wetherell, who led the Opposition on this occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
came out of the House to find that it was raining hard. "By
God!" said he, "if I'd known this, they should have had a few
more divisions!"<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>In 1833, and again ten years later, the Irish party resisted
two Bills by this means, on the latter occasion calling for no
less than forty-four divisions. And when the Copyright Bill of
1839 was being debated, a minority of nine members compelled
one hundred and twenty-seven of their colleagues to
divide sixteen times.</p>

<p>There is, as Gladstone said, no art or science which has
made such advance in modern times as has that of parliamentary
obstruction. Gladstone himself resolutely and systematically
obstructed the passage of the Divorce Bill, as Sir
Robert Peel before him had obstructed Lord Grey's Reform
Bill. These statesmen, however, employed a recognised form
of opposition to some particular measure. It was left for the
Irish party to devise a system of regular opposition to the
conduct of any parliamentary business whatsoever.</p>

<p>Parnell's knowledge of the rules of debate was extensive and
peculiar. He himself acted upon the advice which he once
gave to a new member when he told him that the best way
to learn the regulations of the House was by breaking them.
It was he who originated the idea of employing what he called
"the sacred right of obstruction" as a protest against the
alleged Government neglect of Irish grievances. He sought
by this means to show that, though his party was not powerful
enough to carry through its own work properly, it was
sufficiently strong to prevent the English Government from
doing any work at all. In this way he no doubt thought to
carry out the last wishes of Grattan, and to "keep knocking
at the Union."</p>

<p>The forms of the House of Commons, as Sir George
Cornwall Lewis has said, were avowedly contrived for the
protection of minorities; and they are so effectual for their
purpose as frequently to defeat the will of the great body of
the House, and enable a few members to resist, at least for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
time, a measure desired by the majority.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The Irish have, of
course, always been dissatisfied. If they had happened to be
in the wilderness with Moses, as Bright once observed, they
would probably have complained of the Ten Commandments
as a harassing piece of legislation&mdash;and not altogether without
justification. But in 1874, when they adopted the attitude of
antagonism to the transaction of all business, obstruction in
such a form as this was a novelty, and their more constitutionally-minded
leader, Butt, repudiated Parnell and his
methods. The latter was not to be moved from his purpose,
however, and with half a dozen intrepid and obstinate followers
continued the practice of an organized plan of obstruction,
of which the only flattering thing that can be said is that
it was for a long time completely successful.</p>

<p>Parnell himself deliberately expressed his satisfaction in
thwarting the Government and preventing the progress of
parliamentary business. He gloried in his offence, thinking
very probably that England's difficulty was Ireland's opportunity.
On sixty-nine occasions in 1877, when the House of
Commons was forced to divide, the minorities never consisted
of more than eleven members, and in one hundred divisions
they did not exceed twenty-one. Parnell addressed the House
five hundred times in the session of 1879, constantly repeating
the same arguments, raising points which had already been
ruled out of order, making a variety of frivolous objections,
and showing in a hundred ways that his evident desire was
merely to waste the time of Parliament.</p>

<p>Owing to obstructive Irish tactics, the Land Act of 1881
required no less than fifty-eight sittings before it could be
passed. In the same year the climax of obstruction was
reached, and it became obvious that some measures must be
taken to prevent the continuation of such a state of affairs.
On January 31, which was a Monday, the House of Commons
met at 4.30 p.m. and sat without interval until 9.30 a.m. on
the following Wednesday. But for the intervention of the
Chair, the sitting might have been prolonged indefinitely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Fortunately, Speaker Brand was a strong man, and had
privately determined to put a stop to a condition of things
which was bringing the House into contempt and threatening
the complete breakdown of all legislative business.</p>

<p>On resuming the Chair on the Wednesday morning, the
Speaker rose and addressed the House in a carefully prepared
speech. He began by expressing his unqualified disapproval
of the continual obstruction of a stubborn and inconsiderable
minority, whereby the ordinary rules of procedure had been
rendered ineffective, and the dignity of the House endangered.
Acting on his own responsibility, he declared that a new
course was imperatively demanded. He declined therefore
to call upon any more members to speak, and proceeded to
"put the question," relying upon the House to support him
in this unusual act.</p>

<p>The Speaker had accurately gauged the "sense of the
House";<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> his solution of the difficulty was loudly applauded,
save of course upon the Irish benches, and, after a sitting
that had lasted for over forty-one consecutive hours, weary
members were at last enabled to enjoy a well-earned repose.</p>

<p>Shortly after this memorable scene, a new set of rules was
framed, restricting debate on all dilatory motions, and preventing
any member from making them more than once.
The authority of the Speaker also was increased, and it was
made optional for him to put the question forthwith, if he
thought the rules were being abused. He was also endowed
with the power of at any time silencing an unruly or
obstructive member.</p>

<p>In 1882, Gladstone proposed an alteration of the Procedure
Regulations, which allowed the Speaker or Chairman, when
a subject had been adequately discussed, and it was evidently
the sense of the House that the question be put, so to inform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the House; and, if a motion to this effect was put and carried,
supported by more than two hundred members, or supported
by one hundred and opposed by less than forty, the question
was to be put forthwith. This "Closure" rule was amended
six years later, when it was resolved that, after a question had
been proposed, any member could move that "the question
be now put," and, with the Speaker's approval, this motion
might be put without debate, provided that in the division
not less than one hundred members voted in its support.</p>

<p>Still more stringent regulations have since been made to
thwart the obstructive tendencies of a certain section of every
Opposition. By a recent Standing Order, the end of a debate
may be fixed by resolution of the House for a certain hour
and date, and, if the subject is not disposed of by that time,
the undiscussed remainder must be decided by a vote upon
which there can be no debate. This is known as the
"guillotine" or "closure by compartments," and has been
commented on adversely by all minorities and sedulously
practised by every Government since its inception.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of the many efforts which have been
made to accelerate business, the parliamentary machine moves
but slowly, and the time spent in discussing any measure to
which there is active, sincere, and persistent opposition shows
no signs of diminishing in length. Thus, while the Home
Rule Bill of 1893 required 180 divisions, the Education Bill
of 1902 required 295; and over the Finance Bill of 1909
Parliament spent something like 73 days (or 740 hours) and
divided no less than 420 times.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE AND
PUNISHMENT</h3>


<p>Parliament has ever been most tenacious of its
historic and traditionary rights and privileges. Of
these, freedom of speech and freedom from arrest may
be considered the most important. The right of personal
access to the Crown is claimed by peers, any one of whom
may demand a private audience with the sovereign, and,
though the Commons are not granted a similar privilege, it is
permissible for them to accompany their Speaker when he
presents an address to the King, and to wear ordinary dress
on such an occasion.</p>

<p>In olden days peers enjoyed other indulgences denied to
their humbler brethren. They were, for instance, permitted
to kill deer in the King's forests whenever, in obedience to
a royal summons, they journeyed to or from the sovereign.
At such times the bag was limited to two deer, and these
might only be slain in the presence of the King's Forester.
If that official were not at hand, the sporting peer was
enjoined to blow several loud blasts upon his hunting-horn
before pursuing his quarry to the death.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Peers were further
allowed "benefit of clergy," in the good old days, for such
crimes as highway robbery, horse-stealing and house-breaking,
but only for a first offence. If they took up burglary as
a hobby, or if the robbery of churches became with them
a daily habit, they could no longer escape from the consequences
of their misdeeds, and were haled to prison just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
though they had been mere ordinary mortals. "Benefit
of clergy" was a privilege which was repealed by Act of
Parliament in 1801, and a peer to-day cannot steal a single
gold watch with impunity.</p>

<p>Exemption from arrest on a civil process during the
session, or for forty days before and after, is a privilege which
members of the House of Commons as well as the Lords
have always enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> It extended to their estates until 1857,
and to their servants until 1892. This immunity does not,
however, extend to breaches of the criminal law, nor can it
be claimed in the case of an indictable offence or of contempt
of court, its original object being merely to secure freedom
of arrival and attendance. The Speaker of the Commons,
Thomas Thorpe, who was summoned in Henry VI.'s time
for carrying away certain goods and chattels from the Bishop
of Durham's Palace, was fined £1000, and committed to the
Fleet until this sum should be paid. The question of
privilege was raised, but the House of Lords decided that
the culprit must remain in prison, and the Commons were
directed to elect another Speaker.</p>

<p>In the early days of Parliament, privilege from arrest was
generally enforced by a resolution of the House or by a
Chancery writ, though there is at least one instance of a
member being released without any such formality. This
occurred in the case of a member named Ferrars, who had
been arrested for debt by the Sheriff of London in 1543.
The Sergeant-at-Arms who went to demand his release was
illtreated, and sent back empty-handed. The House thereupon
summoned the sheriff to the Bar, and with him the
creditor who had sued Ferrars, and committed both to
prison.</p>

<p>In 1575 the privilege was extended, the servants of
members of the House of Commons being included within
the pale of its protection. This naturally led to many abuses,
culminating in the case of the notorious Colonel Wanklyn.
This member gave a signed "protection" to a wealthy friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
whom he falsely named as his servant in order to enable him
to escape the payment of a debt which he owed to his own
wife. The fraud being made public, the culprit was expelled
from the House, and went away weeping bitterly, "to the
scandal of his brother officers."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> In the same year a man
named Smalley, the servant of Arthur Hall, member for
Grantham, was arrested for debt and released by the Speaker's
order. It was afterwards discovered that he had arranged
his arrest so as to elude his financial liabilities, and the
indignant House ordered him to be imprisoned and fined
£100.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Further discredit was cast upon one of the ancient
privileges of Parliament by another member named Benson,
who was found guilty of selling "protections" at sixteen
shillings apiece, and was turned out of the House.</p>

<p>If the Commons were justly severe in their treatment of
members who abused this particular privilege, they punished
with even greater severity any unfortunate persons who
attempted to violate it. In 1584 an official of the mighty
Star Chamber was committed to the Tower for daring to
serve a <i>subp&oelig;na</i> on a member of Parliament. At the beginning
of the next century, two officers who had arrested a
member's servant were condemned to ride together upon
a single horse, back to back, through the streets of London.
In this insecure and undignified position they were taken
from Westminster to the Exchange, wearing upon their
breasts a placard inscribed with their offence, an awful
example to all who would dream of laying hands on the
sacred persons of parliamentarians or their dependents.</p>

<p>The immunity which members had hitherto enjoyed was
slightly modified in 1700, when an Act was passed permitting
civil suits to be commenced against them after a dissolution
or prorogation, or during any adjournment of more than
fourteen days. Later on, in George III.'s reign, their privileges
were still further curtailed, their persons alone being
held sacred, and that for a period of only forty days before or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
after the meeting of Parliament. Use was still made of this
privilege as a shield from the power of the law, and as late as
1807 there are instances of the unscrupulous purchase of
seats in the Commons for the sole purpose of obtaining
release from prison or escaping the payment of debt.</p>

<p>To this day members of Parliament are safe from arrest
within the precincts of the Palace of Westminster. Irish
members who had been convicted under the Coercion Act,
in the palmy days of the Land League, found in the House of
Commons a useful if only temporary sanctuary. Dr. Tanner
took his seat there at a time when a warrant for his arrest
had been issued, and it was not until the adjournment of
the House and the return to his hotel of this member, so
badly "wanted by the police," that he could be lawfully
apprehended.</p>

<p>The jealous care with which Parliament guarded its rights
in olden days often threatened to bring the very name of
privilege into contempt. The Commons especially acquired
the pernicious habit of voting that whatsoever displeased
them was an insult to Parliament, requiring instant and
drastic punishment. Books or sermons which criticized or
reflected upon the doings of either House were condemned
wholesale, confiscated, and publicly burnt by the common
hangman; authors or preachers were imprisoned and otherwise
penalized. "The Parliament-men are as great Princes
as any in the World," says Selden, "when whatsoever they
please is privilege of Parliament; no man must know the
number of their privileges, and whatsoever they dislike is
breach of privilege."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Impeachment, imprisonment, fines, confiscation of property,
or committal to the Tower, were among the penalties
meted out with a lavish hand to all who gave offence to the
Commons. In 1624, Dr. Harrys, vicar of Blechingly, was
brought to the bar of the Commons for interfering at elections,
and compelled to confess his guilt, and afterwards to
apologise to his parishioners. A Welsh judge named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Jenkins was summoned before the Long Parliament for
having called the House of Commons a den of thieves, and,
on refusing to "bow himself in this house of Rimmon," was
sentenced to death.</p>

<p>The most trivial faults, the most innocent acts, were from
time to time voted contempts of Parliament, and the offenders
chastised with a barbarity which was out of all proportion to
the nature of their misdeeds. So harmless an offence as
crowding or jostling against a member of Parliament was at
one time considered a crime. In the days when the great
Arthur Onslow occupied the Chair of the House of Commons,
it was his custom to traverse Westminster Hall on his way to
the House, saluting the Judges as he passed. An unfortunate
man who accidentally blocked the Speaker's path on one
occasion was instantly ordered into custody.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Poaching the game of a member of Parliament was also
adjudged a misdemeanour worthy of severe retribution. A
poacher who trespassed on the fishing rights of Admiral
Griffiths, M.P., in 1759, was reprimanded on his knees at the
bar of the Commons.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The presentation of fraudulent petitions has always been
regarded as a breach of parliamentary privilege; and, in 1887,
a man named Bidmead, who presented a petition which was
found to be full of false signatures, was brought to the bar
and severely reprimanded. This process of haling an offender
to the bar to receive the censure of the House was an impressive
one, calculated to strike fear into the boldest heart.
The culprit was brought in, in the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms,
and compelled to kneel at the bar, where the Speaker
sentenced him in his severest tones to such penalties as the
House deemed sufficient to expiate his crime. One wretched
prisoner was so alarmed that he had a fit, and was carried
out in an unconscious condition.</p>

<p>The rule requiring an offender to kneel was not finally
repealed until the middle of the eighteenth century. In 1751<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
an attorney named Crowle was reprimanded on his knees for
misconduct of some kind or other at an election. On rising
to his feet Mr. Crowle carefully wiped the knees of his
trousers, remarking contemptuously that he had never before
been in so dirty a house.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> In this same year Alexander
Murray, brother of the Jacobite Lord Elibank, was summoned
for obstructing the High Bailiff of Westminster at election
time. He resolutely declined to kneel when brought to the
Commons bar, nor could the threats or entreaties of the
Sergeant-at-Arms prevail upon him to conform to the rules
of the House in this respect. "I never kneel but to God,"
he said. "When I have committed a crime I kneel to God
for pardon, but, knowing my own innocence, I can kneel to
no one else." As a punishment for his obstinacy, Murray
was committed to Newgate, and remained there until the
prorogation of Parliament. The close of the session operated
as his release, and he was acclaimed in triumph by the City
populace. When Parliament met again he was once more
committed, but fled abroad, and so escaped further imprisonment.</p>

<p>This ceremony of enforced kneeling was a humiliation
repulsive to many. Windham told Fanny Burney that the
sight of Warren Hastings on his knees at the bar was so
repugnant to his feelings that he looked the other way to
avoid seeing the degradation of the impeached statesman.
"It hurt me," he says, "and I wished it dispensed with."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
This wish soon became universal, and the practice was discontinued
in 1772, Baldwin, the printer of the "St. James's
Chronicle," who was reprimanded for publishing a report of
the parliamentary proceedings, being the last man to kneel
at the bar of the House.</p>

<p>When a member of Parliament incurs the displeasure of
the House its censure may be visited upon him in various
ways, either by a reprimand, or by fine, or by committal to
prison. The first instance of the Commons punishing one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
their own number occurs in 1547, when a member named
Storie was arrested by the Sergeant-at-Arms for speaking
disrespectfully of the Duke of Somerset, and was confined to
the Tower. The House of Commons has never allowed its
members to reflect upon the conduct of those in high places.
It also forbids any criticism of a Resolution of the House,
unless the critical member intends to conclude with a motion
for rescinding it. Eight years after the committal of Storie,
another member, Dr. Parry by name, was brought to the bar
for speaking in the House against a Bill that had already
passed its third reading, saying that it was "full of confiscations,
blood, danger, despair, and terror to the English subjects
of this realm, their brothers, uncles, and kinsfolk."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Dr.
Parry absolutely declined to give his reasons for holding this
view, nor would he deign to explain why the Bill should cause
his uncles to become desperate and terrorstricken. He was
therefore committed to the Tower, and expelled from the
House. Later on an accusation of treason was brought
against him, and a motion made (but, let us hope, not carried)
that he be executed. In 1581, another member, Arthur Hall,
was fined and imprisoned in the Tower for publishing a book
of a slanderous character.</p>

<p>When the House of Commons punished in those days it
certainly never erred on the side of leniency. A Roman
Catholic member named Floyd, who had made use of insulting
expressions with reference to the daughter of James I.,
was found guilty of gross breach of privilege. He was sentenced
to be degraded, branded, whipped, fined £1000, and
to stand twice in the pillory. After this, whatever was left
of him was to be imprisoned for life. The pillory was evidently
a favourite punishment for recalcitrant members, and
as late as 1727 we find a legislator named Ward suffering this
unpleasant penalty in addition to expulsion from the House.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
In James I.'s reign a certain Sir Giles Mompesson,
member of Parliament, was accused of "being a Monopolist."
For this crime he was turned out of the House, perpetually
outlawed, excepted from all general pardons, bereft of his
goods, imprisoned for life, and, last of all, sentenced to be
"for ever held an infamous person."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Another member was
sent to the Tower for "speaking out of season," an offence
which is fortunately no longer considered particularly heinous,
or perhaps few members would be at liberty to-day.</p>

<p>In 1642 Parliament appears to have been especially pitiless,
dispensing fines and imprisonments right and left upon
any one who displeased it. Sir Edward Dering was impeached
for promoting a petition from the county of Kent,
and the petition itself was ordered to be burnt at the hands
of the common hangman. Sir Ralph Hopton was imprisoned
in the Tower for saying in the House that his fellow-members
seemed to ground their views of the King's apostacy upon
evidence insufficient to convict a horse-thief; and a wretched
tradesman named Sandeford, who cursed Parliament and all
its works, was fined a hundred marks, pilloried, whipped, and
sentenced to life-long confinement in a House of Correction.
So assertive of their power and so jealous of their privileges
were the Commons at this time that they even made an order
to issue a warrant for the apprehension of all such persons
as one of their members, Sir Walter Erie, should name.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>Peers and prelates were no safer than the humbler
members from the vindictive spirit of Parliament, and any
breach of its privileges on their part brought instant punishment.
In 1603 the Bishop of Bristol published a book which
was considered by Parliament to be most offensive. At a
conference of both Houses he was sternly rebuked "for presuming
to see more than a Parliament could," when he at
once recanted, withdrew his obnoxious presumptions, and
declared, "first, that he had erred; secondly, that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sorry for it; and, thirdly, that if it were to do again, he
would not do it."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Only on these abject terms could he
expiate his offence. A hundred years later, in 1712, a volume
of sermons written by the Bishop of St. Asaph, deploring the
terms of the peace with France and Spain, was condemned
to be burnt in Palace Yard.</p>

<p>The Sergeant-at-Arms is the official entrusted with the
duty of enforcing the penal decisions of the House of Commons.
All warrants issued by the House are executed by
him. He brings witnesses and culprits to the bar, sees
that members and strangers do not infringe its resolutions,
and has the custody of such persons as may be committed
to his charge. The doorkeepers, messengers, and police employed
in the Commons are under his control, as are the buildings
themselves while Parliament is sitting. As an officer of
the Crown, he may be summoned to attend upon the sovereign
on such occasions as the opening of Parliament, when the
Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms takes his place as the personal
escort of the Speaker. Like his colleagues, the Sergeant
used formerly to eke out a precarious living upon fees, and
received all or a part of the fines inflicted upon members for
absence or unpunctuality. To-day, however, he enjoys a
regular salary, and an official residence.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Only once since the attempt of Colonel Pride to purge
the House have representatives of the law traversed the bar
of the Commons. The Palace of Westminster, within and
without, is guarded by members of the Metropolitan Police,
but they studiously refrain from trespassing upon the sacred
ground that lies within the bar of either House. During the
Speakership of Mr. Gully, however, in 1901, several Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
members declined to leave the House when ordered to do so
for a division, and resisted the Sergeant-at-Arms and his
myrmidons. Stout police-constables were therefore summoned,
and bore the unwilling members struggling to the
door in that kindly but determined grasp which, as Suffragettes
have since learnt by experience, is one of the chief
charms of the A Division.</p>

<p>The right of the Houses of Parliament to regulate their
own internal concerns has always been admitted. In Henry
VI.'s reign the Lord Chief Justice informed the House of
Lords that the High Court of Parliament "is so high and
mighty in its nature that it may make law, and that that is
law it may make no law, and the determination and knowledge
of that privilege belongs to the Lords of the Parliament,
and not to the Justices."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Courts of law have never
interfered with anything that took place in Parliament unless
it were of an essentially criminal character. Parliament, however,
has not always shown the same consideration for courts
of law. In 1703, a man named Ashby brought an action
against the constables of Aylesbury for refusing to record his
vote at an election. The Commons thereupon declared it a
gross breach of privilege that any court other than themselves
should presume to try a case that had any reference to an
election, and proceeded to take into custody everybody concerned
in the affair. The Speaker went in person to the
Court of Queen's Bench to summon the Lord Chief Justice to
attend upon the Commons and explain the law's unjustifiable
interposition. For once, however, the representative of Parliament
was forced to beat an undignified retreat. Old Lord
Chief Justice Holt was a quick-tempered man, and not at all
awed by the presence of Speaker Smith. "If you do not
depart from this court," he said to him in his sternest voice,
"I will commit you, though you have the whole House of
Commons in your belly!"</p>

<p>This was but one example of the numerous collisions
between Parliament and the law, resulting from the former's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
rigid insistence upon bygone privileges, and the difficulty of
settling which questions should be left to the arbitrament of
either authority. If matters were left to the decision of the
Commons, it is clear that everything would probably be
brought within the scope of privilege; if to courts of law, all
privilege would possibly be abolished. Some thought the
former alternative was the least to be feared. "While men
are but men," said Lord Jeffrey, "we must be at the mercy
of a fallible and irresponsible despotism at best; and if we
have to choose, as in an open question, few would hesitate to
say that they would rather have the House of Commons for
a despot than the courts of law."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> But the matter became
ridiculous when Parliament insisted on interfering in questions
which it had clearly no right to decide. In 1721, for instance,
the House of Commons committed the proprietors of a paper
called "Mist's Journal" to Newgate for publishing an article
favouring the restoration of the Pretender. This could
scarcely be considered a breach of privilege, but the House
thought itself empowered to deal with all political offenders.
Since that time no one has been committed, except for a
distinct breach of privilege, or for contempt of Parliament.
The latter term, however, embraces the most trivial offences.
In 1827, a stranger who was visiting the House of Lords left
his umbrella in the cloak-room, by order of the attendant.
On returning to claim his property at the end of the sitting,
he found that his umbrella&mdash;following the universal fashion
of that elusive article&mdash;had disappeared. He proceeded to
bring an action against the doorkeeper, and was awarded
damages amounting to £1 0<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Lord Chancellor Eldon
thereupon summoned him to the bar of the Lords, and forced
him, on pain of imprisonment, to refund the value of his
umbrella and apologise. Four years later, the printer of
"The Times" was fined £100 and sent to Newgate for
having dared to call the Earl of Limerick "a thing with
human pretensions."</p>

<p>The House of Lords has always considered itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
empowered to inflict fines as well as imprisonment for a fixed
period. When the Commons confine an offender they may
put no term to his sentence, and he is released automatically
on a prorogation. For the last two hundred years they have
ceased to exercise the right of fining delinquents, but in
early days, as we have seen, they often inflicted financial
penalties, and stimulated the attendance of their own
members by an inroad upon their pockets.</p>

<p>At the very commencement of parliamentary history
the shires or boroughs whose representatives did not appear
in their places in Parliament were fined £100. In 1580,
any knight who stayed away for a whole session was
fined £20, while citizens and burgesses were fined £10.
Besides this, members lost their pay during absence, and, by
an Act of Henry VIII., boroughs and shires were exonerated
from the payment of wages to members who left Parliament
before the end of the session without the Speaker's
permission.</p>

<p>In similar fashion peers and bishops were punished for
non-attendance, the size of their fines varying in proportion
to the rank of the offender. An ordinance framed in
Henry VI.'s time, about 1452, imposed fines of from £40 to
£100 upon absentee peers, the sum thus raised to be appropriated
to the defence of Calais.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> In 1625 a fine of 5<i>s.</i> per
day was imposed upon peers who disregarded their summons
to Parliament, and we read of the Cinque Ports being mulcted
in the sum of a hundred marks because their baron absented
himself.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> When the Bill for degrading Queen Caroline was
before the Lords a fine of £100 was imposed during the first
three days, and £50 for any subsequent day, on which any
peer did not attend, unless he could prove illness or unavoidable
absence. By a former Standing Order, every lord
who entered the House after prayers was fined, if a baron or
a bishop, 1<i>s.</i>; if of higher rank, 2<i>s.</i> What a contrast to these
degenerate days in which the Lord Chancellor, the bishop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and one peer, hunted up for the purpose, form a reluctant
congregation!</p>

<p>In the days of Charles I. penalties were extremely
necessary if the business of Parliament was to be carried
on at all. Members took their duties lightly, and at times
not more than a dozen would appear in their places at Westminster.
Prynne describes them as wasting their time in
taverns, playhouses, dicing-houses, cockpits, and bowling
alleys, "rambling abroad to such places at unreasonable
Hours of the Night in antique Parliamentary Robes, Vestments
fitter for a Mask or Stage than the gravity of a
Parliament House." They would only come to peep into
the House once or twice a week, he says, to show themselves
in such disguises, and ask, "What news?"<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>In the Parliament which passed the Grand Remonstrance
there were sometimes as many as two hundred absentees.
To remedy this evil it was proposed by Strode that any
member who stayed away without leave should be fined £50,
or expelled. This proposal, says D'Ewes, "was much debated,
but laid aside."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Even those members who attended did so
in a casual and perfunctory fashion, which proved a source
of great inconvenience to colleagues who took their responsibilities
more seriously. In order, therefore, to enforce
punctuality, minor fines were inflicted, and in 1628 an order
was made that any member who came in late for prayers
must contribute 1<i>s.</i> to the poor box. The House met at
seven or eight o'clock in the morning in those days; members
therefore had some excuse for arriving late, and the system
had to be temporarily abandoned in 1641, owing to the interruption
of business resulting from the cries of "Pay! Pay!"
with which unpunctual persons were greeted. "Scenes" would
often take place when members arrived just as the clock was
striking, and either refused to pay their shillings, or flung
them angrily upon the floor for the Sergeant to pick up.
Later on, when the House rose at midday, instead of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the afternoon, the regulation was revived. Speaker Lenthall
himself was late on one occasion, much to the delight of the
House, and, his attention being drawn to the fact, threw
his shilling down on to the table with every sign of
annoyance.</p>

FROM AN ENGRAVING BY SAMUEL COUSINS FROM THE PAINTING BY H. W. BURGESS</span>
</div>

<p>As late as the middle of the eighteenth century members
did not allow their parliamentary duties to interfere with
their social pleasures. Burke once complained because the
Commons rose early in order to attend a <i>fête-champêtre</i>
given by Lady Stanley.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> And in 1751 Horace Walpole told
a friend that on the day appointed for the debate on the
Naturalization Bill the House "adjourned to attend Drury
Lane."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>From time to time attempts were made to secure the
attendance of members by means of a "call of the House," of
which due notice was given, members who failed to answer
their names being punished. A "call" which was taken in
October, 1647, resulted in the discovery that one hundred and
fifty members were absent, and after a prolonged debate it
was decided that they should be ordered to pay a fine of £20
each. This system has fallen into disuse, the last "call"
taking place in 1836.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Five years before this date, however,
on March 17, 1831, three members, including Lord F. L.
Gower, who were not in their places when their names were
called, were given into the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms,
and compelled to pay fines ranging from £8 to £10.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>A member who offends against any of the rules or orders
of the House of Commons may be dealt with in several ways,
either by being silenced, suspended, expelled, or committed
to prison. If any member indulges in irrelevance or tedious
repetition the Speaker can call upon him to discontinue his
speech. Should the offence against order be more serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the Speaker may either order the offender to withdraw from
the House or may "name" him, whereupon, on the motion
of the Leader of the House, he is suspended from its service.
The practice of "naming" originated in 1841, when Speaker
Lenthall, after trying in vain to silence certain noisy
members who were chatting together under the gallery, called
upon Sir W. Carnabie by name. In former days little
unpleasantness seems to have attached to the process of
"naming," and when Speaker Onslow was asked what the
result would be of "naming" a refractory member he could
but answer, "Heaven only knows!"<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>To-day a Speaker may order any member whose conduct
is unruly to withdraw from the House for the remainder of the
sitting. By a Standing Order any member wilfully abusing the
regulations of the House can be "named" by the Chairman
or Speaker, and suspended until the end of the session, unless
the House decides to re-admit him sooner. When a member
is "named," the Sergeant-at-Arms escorts him from the
precincts of the chamber, and he is seen off the premises by
the police. Should he decline to obey the Sergeant's invitation
to accompany him beyond the bar, a couple of elderly
attendants step forward and prepare to expedite his progress
towards the door. If force has to be used in order to make
a member withdraw, his suspension lasts unquestionably until
the end of the session.</p>

<p>The punishment of suspension had not been used for two
hundred years when it was revived in 1877. Immediately
following the extraordinary scenes of obstruction which gave
rise to Speaker Brand's resolute action, a wholesale suspension
of Irish members took place. On February 3, 1881, Parnell
and more than a score of his colleagues were named and
suspended for refusing either to take part in a division or to
withdraw from the House. When the "closure" was applied
for the first time in February, 1885, a scene of uproar ensued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
as a result of which Mr. O'Brien was suspended, and in
March, 1901, as already mentioned, twelve Irish members
who declined to leave their places for a division were forcibly
removed by the Sergeant-at-Arms and police, and subsequently
suspended.</p>

<p>Committal to the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms is nowadays
an uncommon parliamentary punishment, Bradlaugh
being one of the last members to be confined in the Clock
Tower.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Both Houses, however, have the legal right of
imprisoning (at Holloway or elsewhere) any British subjects
who offend against their privileges.</p>

<p>Expulsion from the House of Commons is, perhaps, the
direst penalty that can be inflicted upon a member. In 1714,
Lord Cochrane and Steele the essayist were both expelled&mdash;the
one for spreading false reports on the Stock Exchange,
the other for publishing "The Crisis," a pamphlet antagonistic
in tone to the Government. Some fifty years later Wilkes,
who had been prosecuted for his articles in the "North Briton,"
was also expelled from the House. The voters of Middlesex
at once re-elected him, but Parliament declared his opponent,
the defeated candidate, to be duly elected. In 1782, however,
the resolution against Wilkes was erased from the journals of
the House. At the time of the South Sea Bubble a number
of members were turned out for fraud. Since then, however,
the list of expulsions has dwindled, until to-day such a thing
would be considered a rare and unique occurrence. Though
expulsion does not preclude re-election, a grave moral stigma
attaches to the penalty, and a modern member who incurred
it would find but little consolation in the reflection that he
shared this invidious distinction with men of no less eminence
than Steele and Walpole.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>PARLIAMENTARY DRESS AND DEPORTMENT</h3>


<p>Parliament to-day differs in very many respects
from the Parliaments of the past; nowhere does that
difference express itself more forcibly than in the
remarkable improvement in parliamentary manners of which
the last century has been the witness.</p>

<p>Sir John Eliot's well-known words are far more applicable
to the modern House of Commons than they can ever have
been three hundred years ago. "Noe wher more gravitie can
be found than is represented in that senate," he said, speaking
of the Chamber of which he was so distinguished a member.
"Noe court has more civilitie in itself, nor a face of more
dignitie towards strangers. Noe wher more equall justice can
be found: nor yet, perhaps, more wisdom."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> It was no
doubt a pardonable sense of pride that caused Sir John to
take so optimistic a view of the assembly of his day, for there
is ample evidence to show that the House of Commons of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was not always the
grave or civil chamber which he describes. Its passions
were not invariably under control; they flared up into a
blaze on more than one occasion. The appearance of
Cardinal Wolsey to demand a subsidy for his royal master
was the signal for an outburst of feeling which almost ended
in bloodshed; the Long Parliament was in a perpetual state
of storm and disorder.</p>

<p>During the Stuart period, and even more so towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
close of the Commonwealth, the conduct of the Commons
was anything but decorous. The Speaker of those days
frequently found it impossible to maintain order; the Chair
was held in little respect. The behaviour of the House was
but little better than that of the Irish Parliament in the time
of Elizabeth, which spent most of its time in futile argument
and disagreement: "The more words, the more choler; and
the more speeches, the greater broils."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> It was at the commencement
of the seventeenth century that the first violent
manifestations of party feeling took place which were afterwards
destined to cause so many "scenes" in the Commons.
Owing to the constant discord prevalent there, that House
was, by one member, likened to a cockpit; another wrote to
Sir Dudley Carleton that "many sat there who were more
fit to be among roaring boys"; and a third declared his
desire to escape, not only to the Upper House, but to the
upper world altogether.</p>

<p>During the lengthy debates on the publication of the
Grand Remonstrance in 1641, feeling ran so high that
members would have sheathed their swords in one another's
vitals but for the timely intervention of Hampden. Even
those who did not actively assault each other seem to have
expressed so much malice in their looks as to cause serious
alarm to their opponents. In 1642, for instance, Sir H.
Mildmay complained to the House that the member for
Coventry "looked very fiercely upon him when he spoke,
and that it was done in an unparliamentary way."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>In the reign of Charles II. riotous debates were of frequent
if not daily occurrence. When Titus Oates appeared at the
bar of the Commons to accuse Queen Katherine of high
treason, partisan excitement reached a dangerous pitch. In
1675, a free fight between Lord Cavendish and Sir John
Hanmer was only prevented by the tact of Speaker Seymour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
who resumed the Chair on his own responsibility&mdash;the House
was in Committee at the time&mdash;and managed to quell the
disturbance before blows had been exchanged.</p>

<p>Scenes of a less serious nature took place on many occasions.
Andrew Marvell, the much respected member for
Hull, was entering the House of Commons one morning
when he accidentally stumbled against the outstretched leg
of Sir Philip Harcourt. In recovering himself, Marvell
playfully dealt Sir Philip a resounding box on the ear. The
Speaker at once drew the attention of the House to this
affront, and members became greatly excited. When Marvell
was at length allowed an opportunity of speaking, he explained
that "what passed was through great acquaintance
and familiarity" between Sir Philip and himself, and that
his blow was merely a token of deep affection. After a
heated debate the matter was allowed to drop, though other
members of the House must subsequently have fought shy
of making friends with a man who expressed his liking in
so boisterous and painful a fashion.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>The fact that many members of both Houses frequently
attended the debates in an advanced stage of intoxication
was, perhaps, the cause of most of the parliamentary unpleasantness
of past days. At Westminster, indeed, the
sobriety of legislators was scarcely more noticeable than
at Edinburgh, where the Scottish Parliament that met on
the Restoration of Charles II. was forced to adjourn, owing
to the fact that the Commissioner Middleton and most of
the members were too drunk to deliberate.</p>

<p>Instances of parliamentary intemperance and its natural
results were common enough in those days. In 1621, a
quarrel arose in the House of Lords between the Earl of
Berkshire and Lord Scrope. The former quickly lost his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
temper and laid violent hands on his colleague. For this
he was called to the bar, censured by the Lord Chancellor,
and committed to the Tower. Again, at a conference between
the two English Houses, in 1666, the Lords behaved to one
another with extreme discourtesy. The Duke of Buckingham
opened the proceedings by leaning across Lord Dorchester
in a rude and offensive manner. The latter gently but
firmly removed the intruding elbow, and on being asked if
he were uncomfortable, replied that he certainly was, and
that nowhere but in the House of Lords would the Duke
dare to behave in so boorish a fashion. Buckingham irrelevantly
retorted that he was the better man of the two,
whereupon Dorchester told his noble colleague that he was
a liar. The Duke then struck off the other's hat, seized hold
of his periwig, and began to pull him about the Chamber.
At this moment, luckily, the Lord Chamberlain and several
peers interposed, and the two quarrelsome noblemen were
sent to the Tower to regain control of their tempers.</p>

<p>The Commons meanwhile were behaving in no less reprehensible
a manner. "Sir Allen Brodricke and Sir Allen
Apsly did come drunk the other day into the House," says
Pepys, "and did both speak for half an hour together, and
could not be either laughed, or pulled, or bid to sit down."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
Such a state of things was so usual in either House at the
time as to provoke neither comment nor criticism. The tone
of society may be gauged from the fact that at the end of
the seventeenth century it was not thought peculiar for a
party of Cabinet Ministers, including the Earl of Rochester,
then Lord High Treasurer of England, stripped to their
shirts and riotously intoxicated, to climb the nearest signpost
in order to drink the King's health from a suitable point
of vantage.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>The usual condition of the Commons during the hearing
of election petitions a hundred years later has been forcibly
described by Thomas Townshend. "A House of twenty or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
thirty members," he says, "half asleep during the examination
of witnesses at the bar, the other half absent at Arthur's or
Almack's, ... returning to vote so intoxicated that they
could scarcely speak or stand." It must, however, be
admitted that members' frequent potations did not always
affect their utterance. Indeed, they sometimes appear to
have had an entirely opposite result. In 1676, Lord Carnarvon,
under the influence of wine, made a remarkably
humorous and able speech in the House of Lords, causing
the Duke of Buckingham to exclaim, "The man is inspired,
and claret has done the business!" Charles Townshend, too,
whom Burke called the delight and ornament of the House,
and who was offered the Chancellorship of the Exchequer
by Pitt, seems to have been far more eloquent in his cups
than at any other time. He is chiefly famous for making
what is known as the "Champagne Speech" of May 12th,
1767&mdash;a speech which, as Walpole declared to a friend,
nobody but Townshend could have made, and nobody but
he would have made if he could. It was at once a proof
that his abilities were superior to those of all men, and his
judgment below that of any man. It showed him capable
of being, and unfit to be, Prime Minister. "He beat Chatham
in language, Burke in metaphors, Grenville in presumption,
Rigby in impudence, himself in folly, and everybody in good
humour."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Half a bottle of champagne, as Walpole said,
poured on genuine genius, had kindled this wonderful blaze.</p>

<p>Pitt, as is well known, possessed a marvellously strong
head. He and Dundas one evening finished seven bottles
without the slightest difficulty, and he would often fortify
himself with whole tumblers of his favourite wine before
going down to Westminster.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>It was during the famous debate of February 21, 1783,
when Fox was defending the Peace of Paris, that Pitt retired
behind the Speaker's Chair to be actively unwell, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
same time keeping his hand up to his ear that he might miss
none of his rival's points. His conduct on this occasion
affected one of the sensitive clerks at the Table with a violent
attack of neuralgia&mdash;a providential division of labour, as Pitt
pointed out, whereby he himself had enjoyed the wine while
the clerk had the headache! It has often been considered
surprising that Pitt should have been able to exercise such
influence on the House after drinking three bottles of strong
port, but, as a distinguished statesman has observed, it must
be remembered that he was addressing an assembly few of
whose members had drunk less than two.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the nineteenth century, when
Abbot was in the Chair, the member for Southampton, Fuller
by name, entered the House in a hazy but happy frame of
mind, which induced him to mistake the Speaker in his wig
for an owl in an ivy bush. He was promptly removed by the
Sergeant-at-Arms, and kept in custody until his eyesight had
resumed its normal condition.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Another member, Sir George
Rose, arrived at Westminster in a condition which inspired
him to call upon the Speaker for a comic song, and led to
his being taken in charge by the Sergeant-at-Arms.</p>

<p>Lord Chancellor Brougham used to refresh himself
copiously while upon the Woolsack, and, during his four-hour
speech on the Reform Bill, drank no less than five
tumblers of mulled port and brandy.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> There was, therefore,
perhaps some reason for his extreme indignation when the
Duke of Buckingham referred to the possibility of disturbing
him in the midst of his "potations pottle deep"&mdash;a quotation
which Brougham did not recognize, and which evoked from
him a violent outburst.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Peers and members of Parliament to-day have no such
weaknesses, or, at any rate, refrain from exhibiting them in
Parliament. There have been, of course, exceptional instances,
even in modern times, of persons speaking under the influence
of drink, but these are so rare as scarcely to deserve mention.
An Irishman in a conspicuously genial frame of mind referred
to a Conservative member in the lobby as a "d&mdash;&mdash; fool."
The latter overheard this remark and contemptuously retorted
that his honourable friend was drunk. "I may be drunk,"
admitted the Irishman, "but to-morrow I shall be sober.
Whereas you'll be a d&mdash;&mdash; fool to-morrow, and the next day,
and all the rest of your life!" During one of those interminable
sittings of 1877, when obstruction was at its height,
another Irishman, "weary with watching, and warm with
whisky," applied the same opprobrious term to a fellow
member. On being ordered to withdraw the expression
he explained that it "was only a quotation." "Whether the
remark of the hon. gentleman can be explained by a quotation
or a potation," said the Chairman, "it is equally inadmissible,
and I must beg him in future to mind his p's
and q's."<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Irish members have probably been the cause of more
parliamentary disturbance than all the rest of their colleagues
put together. Daniel O'Connell, whom Disraeli once called
"the vagabond delegate of a foreign priesthood,"<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> was a
perpetual source of trouble to the House. In 1840, he was
the centre of one of the most noisy scenes that has ever
outraged its dignity. Macaulay declared that he had never
before or since seen such unseemly behaviour, or heard such
scurrilous language used in Parliament. Members on both
sides of the House stood up and shouted at the tops of their
voices, shaking their fists in one another's faces.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Lord
Norreys and Lord Maidstone particularly distinguished themselves
by the pandemonium they created, while others of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
colleagues gave farmyard imitations, and for a long time the
whole House continued in a state of ferment. O'Connell's
reference to the sounds emitted by honourable gentlemen as
"beastly bellowings" only made matters worse. As a French
visitor who was present during this scene has described:
"Pendant plusieures heures plus de cinq cents membres
crient de toutes leurs forces 'à l'ordre! à la porte O'Connell!'
le tout accompagné des imitations zoologiques les plus
étranges et les plus affreuses. C'étaient les cris de deux
armées de sauvages en presence."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>"Imitations zoologiques" have always been a popular
but by no means the only method employed by members
desirous of drowning the words of a tiresome speaker. John
Rolle, the hero of the "Rolliad," promoted a "smoking and
spitting party "to interrupt and annoy Burke.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> In 1784, the
latter told a number of youthful opponents who interrupted
him with their howls that he could teach a pack of hounds to
yelp with more melody and equal comprehension. Ten years
before the O'Connell scene Brougham excited the House
to uproar of a similarly puerile character. He remained
calm and unmoved, however, and, when the bestial cries of
his audience subsided for a moment, pleasantly observed that
by a wonderful disposition of nature every animal had its
peculiar mode of expressing itself, and that he was too much
of a philosopher to quarrel with any of those modes&mdash;a
remark which does not appear to have subdued the clamour
to any appreciable extent.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> A similar uproar which the
Speaker was powerless to quell arose in 1872, when Sir
Charles Dilke brought forward a motion to inquire into the
manner in which the income and allowances of the Crown
were spent.</p>

<p>Members who are anxious to bring a debate to a close
still have recourse to sound, crying, "'Vide! 'Vide!" in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
earsplitting fashion, which occasionally evokes a rebuke from
the Speaker. But there is seldom, nowadays, such a scene
of violence as occurred in both Houses upon the dissolution
of Parliament in April, 1831. The Commons indulged in
a painful scene "of bellowing, and roaring, and gnashing
of teeth, which it was almost frightful to look at," says
Cockburn.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> In the Upper House peers behaved no less
childishly. Lord Mansfield doubled up his fist, elbowed
Lord Shaftesbury into the Chair, and hooted Lord Brougham
as he left the House.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Lord Lyndhurst, meanwhile, was
threatening the Duke of Richmond with physical violence,
and the uproar was only quelled by the arrival of the King.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
One must not, of course, forget the notorious modern instance
of ill manners, already described,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> when, in 1893, members
exchanged blows upon the floor of the Commons. This,
however, is a painful exception, little likely to recur.</p>

<p>Politicians have learnt to control their feelings, and the
present publicity of parliamentary proceedings acts as a
salutary deterrent to outbursts of the elemental passions.
Neither House to-day would dream of expressing its emotion
in the open fashion common to Parliaments of long ago.
The sight of a Lower Chamber dissolved in tears is no
longer possible. Yet, in 1626, when, by the King's command,
no discussion was permitted on the question of Buckingham's
impeachment, a lachrymose Speaker led the whole
House of Commons in a chorus of weeping. Two years
later Sir Edward Coke welcomed the introduction of the
Petition of Right in a voice choked with sobs. Wingfield
wept for joy when monopolies were abolished in Queen
Elizabeth's reign,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and we have already noted the tears shed
by Colonel Wanklyn when he was expelled, and by Speaker
Finch when he was forcibly detained in the Chair. Fox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
shed frequent tears in the House of Commons; Pitt wept
bitterly when his friend, Lord Melville, was impeached.
Lord Chancellors, too, were not ashamed to express their
feelings in loud sobs, Eldon's eyes becoming sympathetically
moist, while even the "rugged Thurlow" sprinkled the
Woolsack with his tears.</p>

<p>Members no longer weep, except perchance in the privacy
of their own homes; nor do they follow their predecessors'
fashion of converting the House of Commons into a smoking-room
or a lounge, in which to sleep off the effects of their
potations. The free and easy habits of seventeenth-century politicians
made it necessary for a regulation to be framed that
"No tobacco should be taken by any member in the gallery,
nor at the table sitting in Committees."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> And it was no
uncommon sight, a hundred years ago, to see members
stretched at full length on the benches of the Chamber, with
their feet resting on the backs of the seats in front of them,
punctuating the proceedings with their stertorous snores.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Lord North was notorious for his gift of somnolence in
the House of Commons. "Behold," said Edmund Burke,
with that indifferent taste for which he was noted, as he
pointed to the recumbent figure of the Prime Minister, "the
Government, if not defunct, at least nods; brother Lazarus
is not dead, but sleepeth." North was dozing on another
occasion when a member attacked him fiercely, saying that
he ought certainly to be impeached for his misdeeds. "At
least," exclaimed the Minister, waking for a moment, "allow
me the criminal's usual privilege&mdash;a night of rest before the
execution!"<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> He felt no shame at giving way to slumber in
debate, and when an opponent remarked that "Even in the
midst of these perils, the noble lord is asleep!" "I wish to
God I was!" he replied with heartfelt fervour.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
always take the opportunity afforded by a lengthy speech
to snatch forty winks. Once, when the long-winded Colonel
Barré was addressing the House on the naval history of
England, tracing it back to the earliest ages, North asked
a friend to wake him up as soon as the speaker approached
modern times. When at length he was aroused, "Where
are we?" asked the Premier, anxiously. "At the battle
of La Hogue, my lord." "Oh, my dear friend," said North,
"you've woken me a century too soon!"<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>A marked improvement in the conduct of modern debate
is to be noticed in the comparatively inoffensive character of
the epithets used by members with reference to their opponents.
The decencies of debate are, as a rule, religiously observed.
Recriminations are rare. Measures are attacked, not men.
The secession of a statesman is considered a political but not
a personal offence, and what Palmerston once called the
"puerile vanity of consistency" is no longer worshipped fanatically.
Gladstone rightly called the House of Commons a
"school of temper," as well as a school of honour and of
justice. Offensive allusions have always been deprecated
there, but it is only within the last few score years that
members have controlled their tongues to any appreciable
extent in this direction. Hasty remarks are nowadays withdrawn
at the first suggestion of the Speaker, though on occasion
an apology may be as offensive as the original insult. Lord
Robert Cecil (afterwards Lord Salisbury) said of a speech of
Gladstone's in 1861, that it was "worthy of a pettifogging
attorney." Soon afterwards he rose in the House, and said
that he wished to apologise for a remark he had lately made.
"I observed that the speech of the right hon. gentleman was
worthy of a pettifogging attorney," he said, "and I now hasten
to offer my apologies&mdash;to the attornies!"</p>

<p>It is usual nowadays to wrap up offensive criticisms in a
more or less palatable covering, to attack by inference rather
than by direct assault. "I am no party man," said Colonel
Sibthorpe, member for Lincoln, after the dissolution of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Robert Peel's Government. "I have never acted from party
feelings; but I must say I do not like the countenances of
honourable gentlemen opposite, for I believe them to be the
index of their minds. I can only say, in conclusion, that
I earnestly hope that God will grant the country a speedy
deliverance from such a band."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> This is a good example of
an unpleasant thing framed in a manner which does not lay
it open to the stigma of disorderly language, and is just as
effective as that oft-quoted attack made by a member of the
Irish House of Commons on George Ponsonby (afterwards
Irish Chancellor), whose sister was sitting in the gallery at the
time. "These Ponsonbys are the curse of my country," said
the member; "they are prostitutes, personally and politically&mdash;from
the toothless old hag who is now grinning in the
gallery to the white-livered scoundrel who is now shivering
on the floor!"<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>Members who consider themselves aggrieved or insulted
have now no redress save by an appeal to the Speaker. In
old days they often took the matter into their own hands, and
many a duel was the outcome of hasty words spoken in
Parliament. So prevalent, indeed, did the habit of duelling
become, that in 1641 a resolution was passed in the Commons
empowering the Speaker to arrest any member who either
sent or received a challenge. The practice of parliamentary
duelling long continued, in spite of every effort to stifle it.
Wilkes was wounded in 1763 in Hyde Park by a member
named Martin, who had called him "a cowardly scoundrel."
Lord Castlereagh and Canning met in 1809, and had, in
consequence, to resign their seats in the Cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Lord
Alvanley fought Morgan O'Connell, son of the Liberator, on
his father's account. Charles James Fox was challenged by
Mr. Adam, of the Ordnance Department, for a personal attack
made in the House of Commons, and faced him in the old
Kensington Gravel Pits. At the first shot Adam's bullet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
lodged harmlessly in his opponent's belt. "If you hadn't
used Ordnance powder," said Fox, with a laugh, as he shook
hands with Adam after the fight, "I should have been a dead
man."<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>If duels were fought in those days on very slight provocation,
challenges were also occasionally declined on equally
poor grounds. Colonel Luttrell, member for Middlesex, and
afterwards Lord Carhampton, refused to fight his own father,
not because he was his father, but because he was not a
gentleman!</p>

<p>The last duel between politicians was that fought by the
Duke of Wellington and Lord Winchelsea, as the result of
some remarks made by the latter during a debate on the
Roman Catholic Emancipation Bill in 1830. Since that time
no parliamentary dispute has been referred to the arbitrament
of the pistol.</p>

<p>Although there has been a perceptible improvement in
parliamentary deportment as the centuries have advanced,
the same can scarcely be said of parliamentary dress. In the
time of Charles II., knee-breeches, silk stockings, and silver-buckled
shoes were absolutely <i>de rigueur</i> for members of the
Commons. A hundred years later members of Parliament
always wore court dress, with bag-wig and sword, in the
House. The formal costume prescribed by etiquette was
rigidly adhered to, and none but county members were
permitted the privilege of wearing spurs.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> At this time, too,
Cabinet Ministers were never seen in Parliament without the
ribbons and decorations of the various orders to which they
belonged. The regulation which bids the mover and seconder
of the Address to appear in court dress on the first day of the
new Parliament is the only relic of this custom.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago no member of either House would have
appeared within the precincts of the Palace of Westminster
wearing anything upon his head but a high silk hat. Gradually,
however, a certain laxity in the matter of head-gear has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
crept into Parliament, and to-day, not only "bowlers," but
even "cricketing caps" may be seen reposing upon the
unabashed heads of members. Peers, as a rule, conform to
the older fashion, and Cabinet Ministers usually dress in a
respectably sombre garb. But among the rank and file of
the House of Commons may occasionally be found members
wearing check suits of the lightest and loudest patterns, and
hats of every conceivable variety, ranging from the æsthetic
"Homburg" to the humble cloth cap. The passing of the
top hat must necessarily appear somewhat in the light of a
tragedy to older parliamentarians. In both Houses the hat
has long come to be regarded as a sacred symbol. It is with
this article of clothing that the member daily secures his
claim to a seat on the benches of the House of Commons;
with a hat he occasionally expresses his enthusiasm or sympathy;
on a hat does he sit at the close of a speech, with
the certainty of raising a laugh; and without a hat he cannot
speak upon a point of order when the House has been cleared
for a division.</p>

<p>When the Labour Party began to take an important place
in the popular assembly, it was thought that this democratic
invasion would have an actively detrimental effect upon the
dress of the House. Old-fashioned members shook their
heads and prophesied an influx of hobnailed artisans, clad in
corduroys, their trousers confined at the knee with string,
and in their mouths a short clay pipe. These gloomy forebodings
have not been realised. With very few exceptions
the dress of Labour members is little calculated to offend the
most sensitive eye, though it was certainly one of their
number who first entered a startled House of Commons in a
tweed stalking-cap&mdash;a form of head-dress which it is certainly
difficult to forgive.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>PARLIAMENTARY ELOQUENCE</h3>


<p>When Pitt was asked what he considered most to be
lamented, the lost books of Livy, or those of Tacitus,
he replied that to the recovery of either of these
he would prefer that of a speech by Bolingbroke. Not a
fragment of what Dean Swift called the "invincible eloquence"
of that statesman is left to us. But though we are compelled
to take his reputation as an orator on trust, we should do
wrong to complain, for it is more than probable that a perusal
of Bolingbroke's speeches to-day would prove disappointing.</p>

<p>"Words that breathed fire are ashes on the page," and
the utterances that have stirred a thousand hearts in the
Senates of old days too often leave the modern reader cold
and unmoved. We miss the inflections of a magical voice,
the stimulating plaudits of friends or followers, the magnetism
that can only be communicated by a personal intercourse
between a speaker and his audience. The reading of old
speeches is, as Lord Rosebery has observed, a dreary and
reluctant pilgrimage which few willingly undertake. It
supplies, as a rule, but a poor explanation of the effect which
the eloquence of past orators produced upon their contemporaries.
It is like attending an undress rehearsal of a play
in an empty theatre on a cold winter's afternoon. The glamour
of costume, of limelight, is lacking; the atmosphere of appreciation,
excitement, enthusiasm, is absent. The difference
between the spoken and the published oration has been aptly
defined as the difference between some magnificent temple
laid open to the studious contemplation of a solitary visitant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and the same edifice beheld amidst the fullest accompaniments
of sacrificial movement and splendour, thronged with
adoring crowds, and resounding with solemn harmonies.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>It has often been affirmed that no speech in Parliament
has ever resulted in the winning of a division. Byron declared
that "not Cicero himself, nor probably the Messiah, could
have altered the vote of a single lord of the Bedchamber or
Bishop."<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> There are, however, one or two instances of
orations which have been so moving in their appeal that they
may claim to be exceptions to this rule. Plunket's famous
speech in the debate on Grattan's motion for Catholic Emancipation
in 1807 is said to have gained many votes. Macaulay
won the support of several opponents by an eloquent speech
on the second reading of Lord Mahon's Copyright Bill in
1842, and, on a Bill introduced by Lord Hotham to exclude
certain persons holding offices from the House of Commons,
actually caused the anticipated majority to be reversed.</p>

<p>On one memorable occasion when Sheridan, with that
impassioned oratory for which he had already become famous,
was advocating the prosecution of Warren Hastings, the
House of Commons was so stirred that a motion for adjournment
was made in order to give members time to recover
from the overpowering effect of his eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Again, during
the debate on Commercial Distress in December, 1847, Peel
roused the fury of the Protectionists by a violent and able
speech, and, when he resumed his seat, an adjournment was
moved on the ground that the House was not in a condition
to vote dispassionately. Burke, too, seems at times to have
stimulated his hearers to an active expression of their
emotion; and when he was lamenting the employment of
Indians in the American War, a fellow-member was so moved
that he offered to nail a copy of his speech upon the door of
every church in the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Yet the speeches of Burke and Sheridan do not affect us
to-day with anything but a mild enthusiasm, chiefly founded
upon our admiration of their literary excellence. We remain
comparatively indifferent to their appeal; our hearts beat no
faster as we read.</p>

<p>Sheridan's two orations on the subject of Warren Hastings'
impeachment&mdash;the one delivered in the House of Commons
on February 7, 1787, and the other in Westminster Hall
during the trial&mdash;have been considered among the very finest
ever made in Parliament. It was after the first of these, which
lasted for five hours, that the House adjourned to enable
members to survey the question calmly, freed from the spell
of the enchanter. Sheridan's style, according to Burke, was
"something between poetry and prose, and better than
either."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Even the fastidious Byron declared him to be the
only speaker he ever wished to hear at greater length. He
was offered £1000 by a publisher for his great "Begum
Speech," if he would but consent to correct the proofs; but
for long he refused. Eventually he agreed to its publication,
but by that time popular interest had subsided.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> As much
as fifty guineas was paid for a seat to hear his speech at the
trial of Hastings, when, as Ben Jonson wrote of Bacon,
"the fear of every man that heard him was lest he should
make an end."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>The speeches of Burke, whom Macaulay has described
as the greatest man since Milton, are perhaps the most suitable
for perusal of any ever delivered in Parliament. They
read better than they sounded as delivered; they are rather
pamphlets than orations. Burke himself was deficient in many
of the qualities of an orator. His voice was harsh and his
gestures ungainly. He never consulted the prejudices of his
audience. His lapses from good taste were frequent, and
among his most splendid passages may be found occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
coarse and vulgar epithets and expressions. Yet so great
was his eloquence, so marvellous his oratorical powers, that
Byron has included him with Pitt and Fox among the
"wondrous three whose words were sparks of immortality."
And the florid Dr. Parr can scarcely find words sufficiently
eulogistic to sing his praises.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>In the seventeenth century parliamentary attendance and
eloquence were equally poor. Not only did many members
speak indifferently; at times there would be long intervals
of silence when members did not speak at all. "A pause for
two or three minutes," ... "The House sat looking at each
other,"<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> are some of the entries in the reports which must
strike the modern mind, accustomed to the present House
of Commons, as peculiar. Steele described the House of his
day as being composed of silent people oppressed by the
choice of a great deal to say, and of eloquent people ignorant
that what they said was nothing to the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>It was not until the Georgian age that parliamentary
oratory reached its heyday. Then, too, speeches began to
lengthen, and by the time Lord North became Prime Minister
it was not unusual for a member to address the House for
two or three hours on end. Lord Brougham once spoke for
six hours on the amendment of the law. Even in Walpole's
day occasional prolixity was not unknown. One Hutcheson,
member for Hastings, when the Septennial Bill of 1716 was
under discussion, made a speech of which the summary fills
more than twenty-five pages of the Parliamentary History.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
Again, when David Hartley, a notorious bore, rose to speak
one day, Walpole went home, changed his clothes, rode to
Hampstead, returned, changed once more, and came back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to the House to find this tiresome member still upon his
legs.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Chatham was the first statesman to make a habit of
delivering long speeches. The practice was never popular,
and has now fallen into desuetude. The rising to his feet
of a tedious member has ever been the signal for the House
to clear as though by magic. Sergeant Hewitt, member
for Coventry in 1761, was a well-known parliamentary
emetic. "Is the House up?" asked a friend of Charles
Townshend, seeing the latter leaving St. Stephen's Chapel.
"No," replied Townshend, "but Hewitt is!"<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> The departure
of his audience is, however, a hint to which the habitual
bore is generally impervious. A dull and lengthy speaker,
addressing empty benches in the House of Commons,
whispered to a friend that the absence of members did not
affect him, as he was speaking to posterity. "If you go on
at this rate," was the unkind reply, "you'll see your audience
before you!"<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>When Gladstone brought in his first Budget in 1853 he
spoke for five hours. He had been advised by Sir Robert
Peel to be long and diffuse, rather than short and concise,
seeing that the House of Commons was composed of men of
such various ways of thinking, and it was important to put his
case from many different points of view so as to appeal
to the idiosyncrasies of each.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In the days of his Premiership,
however, Gladstone's speeches were considerably shortened,
and even the introduction of so momentous and intricate
a measure as the Home Rule Bill of 1886 was accomplished
in three and a half hours. Lengthy speeches are no longer
fashionable, though Mr. Biggar spoke for four hours on a
famous occasion in 1890, and Mr. Lloyd George occupied
the same time in unfolding the much-discussed Finance Bill
of 1909.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Though the oratorical masterpieces of the past may, for
the most part, be dull reading, to the student or historian they
must always prove interesting and instructive, as revealing
those peculiar qualities which appeal to a parliamentary
audience. They explain to a certain extent what it is that
a speech must possess in order to meet with the approval
of either House.</p>

<p>Parliament&mdash;and more especially the House of Commons&mdash;is
no very lenient critic; but it is a sound one. It pardons
the faults of style or manner due to inexperience; it tolerates
homeliness that is the outcome of sincerity. It has a keen
eye for motives, and anything pretentious or dishonest is an
abomination to it. Matter is of far greater importance than
manner, and Parliament agrees with Sir Thomas More that
whereas "much folly is uttered with pointed polished speech,
so many, boisterous and rude in language, see deep indeed,
and give right substantial counsel."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Sincerity, in fact, has
far more influence in the House of Commons than either
brilliancy or wit, and any attempt at platform heroics is certain
to fail. There is nothing the House is so fond of, Sheil
used to say, as facts.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> There is nothing it so much resents,
we might now add, as violations of good taste. This
fastidiousness is no doubt of modern growth, for we find
Burke's coarseness readily condoned, and Sheil himself
lapsing into occasional vulgarity.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>Like all assemblies of human beings, Parliament has
always welcomed an opportunity for laughter. In the House
of Commons the poorest joke creates amusement; the man
who sits upon his hat at once becomes a popular favourite;
a "bull" is ever acceptable. When Sheridan, in 1840,
attacked another member, saying, "There he stands, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Speaker, like a crocodile, with his hands in his pockets,
shedding false tears!" the House rocked with laughter.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
Yet the phrase did not originate with Sheridan, but was one
of the many "bulls" that had been coined by that prince of
bull-makers, Sir Boyle Roche. It was Roche who declared
that he could not be in two places at once "like a bird"; who
attempted to "shunt a question by a side-wind"; and
announced that he was prepared to sacrifice not merely a part
but the whole of the Constitution to preserve the remainder!
"What, Mr. Speaker!" he inquired on a famous occasion in the
Irish House of Commons, "are we to beggar ourselves for
fear of vexing posterity? Now, I would ask the honourable
gentleman, and this <i>still more</i> honourable House, why we
should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for
<i>posterity</i>; for what has posterity done for us?"<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>"The House loves good sense and joking, and nothing
else," said Sir T. F. Buxton, in 1819; "and the object of its
utter aversion is that species of eloquence which may be
called Philippian."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Sentimentality of any kind is rarely
tolerated in Parliament, as may be seen by the indifference
with which Burke's dagger and Lord Brougham's melodramatic
prayer were greeted. When Bright, during the
Crimean War, delivered himself of that famous phrase,
"The Angel of Death has been abroad throughout the land;
you may almost hear the beating of its wings!" it was a
question as to how members would take so sentimental a
simile. Had the speaker substituted the word "flapping"
for "beating," as Cobden afterwards observed to him, they
would have roared with laughter.</p>

<p>The House of Commons, as a writer has remarked, is a
body without any principles or prejudices, except against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
bores. "He who comes to it with a good reputation has no
better chance than he who besieges it with a bad one. It
rejects all pretensions it has not of itself justified, and all
fame it has not itself conferred."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> It has, indeed, always
been remarkable for a great reluctance in confirming reputations
for oratory gained elsewhere. Wilkes could sway the
populace with his grandiloquent declamations, but failed
ignominiously in Parliament; Kenealy was refused a hearing.
The chastening effect of the Lower House is notorious, and
many a conceited, self-opiniated individual has found his
level after a brief course of subjection to what Sir James
Mackintosh called the "curry-comb of the House of
Commons."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Besides bores and demagogues, of which it is justly
intolerant, the House of Commons may at one time be
said to have numbered lawyers among its pet aversions.
The latter are apt to lecture their fellow-members as though
they were addressing a jury, explaining the most patent facts,
and generally assuming a didactic air which the House finds
it difficult to brook.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> This perhaps explains the failure of
such distinguished men as Lord Jeffrey and Sir James
Mackintosh, both eloquent lawyers who made little or no
mark in Parliament, and of many other "gentlemen of the
long robe," as Disraeli contemptuously called them.</p>

<p>Speaking in Parliament is indeed a matter very different
to addressing an audience in the country, on the hustings, or
in some local town hall. The platitudes that evoke such
enthusiasm when delivered from a village platform fall very
flat in either House. The chilling atmosphere and sparse
attendance of the Lords is not conducive to feelings of self-confidence:
the critical gaze of fellow-members in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Commons is little calculated to alleviate a sudden paroxysm
of shyness.</p>

<p>The unknown parliamentary speaker is greeted with a
respectful but ominous silence when he rises to his feet.
He misses the applause of electors or tenantry to which he
is accustomed in his constituency or on his estate. He has
no table on which to place his sheaf of notes; there is no
water-bottle at hand to moisten his parched lips or give him
a moment's pause when the stream of his eloquence runs
temporarily dry. He cannot choose the best moment for
delivering his speech, but must be content to take such
opportunities as are afforded by circumstances. In the
House of Commons a member may have waited half the
night to catch the elusive eye of the Speaker&mdash;though a
man who wishes to make his maiden speech is usually
accorded this privilege&mdash;and, by the time his turn comes,
most of his choicest and brightest thoughts have already
been anticipated by former speakers. It is not, therefore, to
be wondered at that many men find themselves unequal to
the task of passing successfully through this ordeal, and that
the maiden speech of a future statesman has often proved a
complete fiasco.</p>

<p>In 1601, we read of a Mr. Zachary Lock, a member who
"began to speak, who for very fear shook, so that he could not
proceed, but stood still awhile, and at length sat down."<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> This
same experience has since befallen many another politician.
The bravest men become inarticulate in similar circumstances.
After the naval victory of June 1, 1794, Vice-Admiral Sir
Alan Gardiner received a vote of thanks from the House
of Commons, and, though he had taken the precaution of
fortifying himself with several bottles of Madeira, could
scarcely summon up courage to mumble a reply.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> And in
our own time we have seen another gallant officer overcome
with "House-fright" to such an extent as to be unable to
deliver the message which, in his official capacity as Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Rod, he had brought to the Commons. John Bright never
rose in the House without what he called "a trembling
of the knees." Gladstone was always intensely nervous
before a big speech. Disraeli declared that he would
rather lead a forlorn hope than face the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>A good description of the sensations felt by a panic-stricken
member making his debut is given by Lord Guilford,
son of Lord North, whose appearance in the House was brief, if
not exactly meteoric. "I brought out two or three sentences,"
he says, "when a mist seemed to rise before my eyes. I then
lost my recollection, and could see nothing but the Speaker's
wig, which swelled and swelled and swelled till it covered the
whole House."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>The failure of a first speech has not always been the
presage of a politician's future non-success. Addison broke
down on the only occasion on which he attempted to address
the House, yet he reached high office as Irish Secretary
before he had been nine years in Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Walpole's
first speech was a complete failure, as was, in a lesser degree,
Canning's, though both were listened to in silence. Even the
silver-tongued Sheridan himself made a poor impression upon
the House with his earliest effort. After delivering his
maiden speech, he sought out his friend Woodfall, who
had been sitting in the gallery, and asked for a candid
opinion. "I don't think this is your line," said Woodfall.
"You had much better have stuck to your former pursuits."
Sheridan pondered for a moment. "It is <i>in</i> me," he said at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
length with conviction, "and, by God, it shall come out!"<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
It certainly did.</p>

<p>Disraeli, as is well known, was not even listened to, and
had to bring his maiden speech to an abrupt end. "The
time will come when you <i>shall</i> hear me!" he exclaimed
prophetically as he resumed his seat. Such treatment
was, however, unusual, for though the House of Commons
is occasionally, as Pepys called it, a beast not to be
understood, so variable and uncertain are its moods, new
members are commonly accorded a patient and attentive
hearing.</p>

<p>Sometimes a momentary breakdown has been retrieved
under the stimulus of encouraging cheers from the House,
and an infelicitous beginning has led to an eloquent peroration.
Lord Ashley, afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury, had prepared
a speech on behalf of the Treason Bill of 1695, which
enacted that all persons indicted for high treason should
have a copy of the indictment supplied to them and be
allowed the assistance of counsel. He was, however, so
overcome with nervousness on rising to his feet, that he could
not proceed. Wittily recovering himself, "If I, who rise
only to give my opinion on the Bill now depending,
am so confounded that I am unable to express the least
of what I proposed to say," he observed, "what must be the
condition of that man who without any assistance is pleading
for his life, and is under apprehensions of being deprived of
it?" He thus contrived to turn his nervousness to good
account. Again, when Steele was brought to the bar for
publishing "The Crisis," a young member, Lord Finch,
whose sister Steele had defended in the "Guardian" against
a libel, rose to make a maiden speech on behalf of his friend.
After a few confused sentences the youthful speaker broke
down and was unable to proceed. "Strange," he exclaimed,
as he sat down in despair, "that I cannot speak for this man,
though I could readily fight for him!" This remark elicited
so much cheering that the member took heart, rose once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
more, and made an able speech, which he subsequently
followed up with many another.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Although early failure is no sure gauge of a politician's
reputation or worth, many a happy first speech has raised
hopes that remained eternally unfulfilled. In the eighteenth
century James Erskine, Lord Grange, made a brilliant
maiden effort in the Commons and was much applauded.
But the House soon grew weary of his broad Scots accent,
and after hearing him patiently three or four times, gradually
ceased to listen to him altogether.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> William Gerard Hamilton,
secretary to Lord Halifax (Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland), and
afterwards Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer, though not
fulfilling Bolingbroke's definition of eloquence,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> earned the
title of "single-speech Hamilton" by one display of oratory
which was never repeated.</p>

<p>It is customary for the parliamentary novice to crave the
indulgence of the House for such faults of manner or style
as may be the result of youth or inexperience. This modest
attitude on the part of a speaker inspires his audience
favourably; they become infused with a glow of conscious
superiority which is most agreeable and inclines them to
listen with a kindly ear to the utterances of the budding
politician. Not always, however, is this humility expressed.
William Cobbett began his maiden speech on January 29,
1833, by remarking that in the short period during which he
had sat in the House he had heard a great deal of vain and
unprofitable conversation.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Hunt, the Preston demagogue,
showed his contempt for the Commons and his own self-assurance
by speaking six times on six different subjects
on the very first night of his introduction.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> William Cowper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
afterwards Lord Chancellor, addressed the House three
times on the day he took his seat.</p>

<p>In the House of Lords, too, can be heard maiden speeches
delivered in many varying styles. One perhaps may be
made by an ex-Cabinet Minister, a distinguished member
of Parliament recently promoted to the Upper House,
apologising in abject tones for his lack of experience, and
commending his humble efforts to the indulgence of his
audience. Another emanates from some youthful nobleman
who has just succeeded to a peerage, whose political
experience has yet to be won, and who addresses his peers
in the didactic fashion of a headmaster lecturing a form
of rather unintelligent schoolboys. It is not so very long
ago that a young peer&mdash;who has since made the acquaintance
of most divisions of the Supreme Court, from the Bankruptcy
to the Divorce&mdash;astonished and entertained his colleagues by
closing his peroration with a fervent prayer that God might
long spare him to assist in their lordships' deliberations.</p>

<p>There is a golden mean between the two styles, the
humble and the haughty, which it is well for the embryo
politician to cultivate before he attempts to impress
Parliament with his eloquence.</p>

<p>Oratory has been defined in many different ways by
many different writers. Lord Chesterfield and Dr. Johnson,
respectively, described it as the power of persuading people,
or of beating down an adversary's arguments and putting
better ones in their place. The business of the orator,
according to Sir James Mackintosh, is to state plainly, to
reason calmly, to seem transported into vehemence by his
feelings, and roused into splendid imagery or description by
his subject, but always to return to fact and argument, as
that on which alone he is earnestly bent.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Gladstone, again,
defined oratory as the speaker's power of receiving from his
audience in a vapour that which he pours back upon them
in a flood.</p>

<p>Oratory is perhaps the gift of the gods, but skill in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
speaking is undoubtedly an art that can be acquired by
practice, if sought diligently and with patience. Demosthenes
gloried in the smell of the lamp; Cicero learnt every speech
by heart. The former would go down to the seashore on a
stormy day, fill his mouth with pebbles, and speak loudly to
the ocean, thus accustoming himself to the murmur of
popular assemblies; the latter on one occasion rehearsed
a speech so diligently that he had little strength left to
deliver it on the following day. The sight of a modern
politician sitting on the pier at Brighton delivering a marine
address as intelligibly as a mouthful of gravel would permit,
is one that would only excite feelings of alarm in the bosoms
of his friends; the thought of a Cabinet Minister fainting
before his looking-glass, as the result of an excessive rehearsal
of his peroration, is more pathetic than practical. There is,
however, nothing to prevent a member of Parliament from
practising his elocution upon the trees of the forest, as
Grattan did,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> or upon the House of Commons itself, and it is
thus alone that he will acquire proficiency in that art in
which it is so desirable for the statesman to excel. "It is
absolutely necessary for you to speak in Parliament," Lord
Chesterfield wrote to his long-suffering son. "It requires
only a little human attention and no supernatural gifts."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>Charles James Fox resolved, when young, to speak at
least once every night in the House. During five whole
sessions he held manfully to this resolution, with the exception
of one single evening&mdash;an exception which he afterwards
regretted. He thus became the most brilliant debater that
ever lived, "vehement in his elocution, ardent in his language,
prompt in his invention of argument, adroit in its use."<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> He
was, however, too impetuous to be as great an orator as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
rival Pitt, whose majestic eloquence was almost divine,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> and
offended continually by the tautology of his diction and the
constant repetition of his arguments. The hesitation and
lack of grace of his delivery detracted greatly from the force
of his speeches; the keenness of his sabre, as Walpole said,
was blunted by the difficulty with which he drew it from the
scabbard.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> In a comparison of the two statesmen, Flood
calls Pitt's speeches "didactic declamations," and those of
Fox "argumentative conversations."<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>It was said that it required great mental exertion to follow
Fox while he was speaking, but none to remember what he
had said; but that it was easy to follow Pitt, but hard to
remember what there was in his speech that had pleased one.
The difference between the two men was the difference
between the orator and the debater. It resulted largely from
the fact that the one gave much time to the preparation of his
speeches, while the other relied upon the inspiration of the
moment. Pitt, as Porson says, carefully considered his
sentences before he uttered them; Fox threw himself into
the middle of his, "and left it to God Almighty to get him
out again."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> If the former was the more dignified as a
speaker, the latter scored by being always so terribly in
earnest. Grattan, who affirmed that Pitt's eloquence marked
an era in the senate, that it resembled "sometimes the thunder,
and sometimes the music, of the spheres," and admitted that
Pitt was right nine times for once that Fox was right, declared
that that once of Fox was worth all the other nine times
of Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>No doubt the Parliament of those days was not so critical
a body as it has since become. Lord Chesterfield, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
held it in the profoundest contempt. "When I first came
into the House of Commons," he says, "I respected that
assembly as a venerable one; and felt a certain awe upon
me; but, upon better acquaintance, that awe soon vanished;
and I discovered that, of the five hundred and sixty, not
above thirty could understand reason, and that all the rest
were <i>peuple</i>; that those thirty only required plain common-sense,
dressed up in good language; and that all the others
only required flowing and harmonious periods, whether they
conveyed any meaning or not; having ears to hear, but not
sense enough to judge."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> This scathing indictment of the
intelligence of the Commons may possibly have been true at
the time when it was written: it would certainly not be
applicable to-day. Meaningless periods, however harmonious,
are no longer tolerated. In Lord Chesterfield's day, however,
sound seems to have been more important than sense, as may
be gathered from an account he gives elsewhere of a speech
made in 1751 in the House of Lords. He was speaking upon
a Bill for the Reform of the Calendar, a subject upon which
he knew absolutely nothing. To conceal his ignorance he
conceived the idea of giving the House an historical account
of calendars generally, from Ancient Egyptian to modern
times, being particularly attentive to the choice of his
words, to the harmony of his periods, and to his elocution.
The peers were enchanted. "They thought I informed," he
explains, "because I pleased them; and many of them said
that I had made the whole very clear to them, when, God
knows, I had not even attempted it."<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>The gift of oratory is most certainly heaven-born, but its
development demands a vast amount of purely mundane
labour. The best speeches have ever been those in the preparation
of which the most time and trouble have been
expended. Burke's masterpieces were essays, laboriously
constructed in the study; Sheridan's elaborate impromptus
were carefully devised beforehand, and, if successful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
occasionally repeated.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Chatham, whose wonderful dominion
over the House does not perhaps appear in his speeches,
chose his words with the greatest care, and confided to a
friend that in order to improve his vocabulary he had read
"Bailey's Dictionary" twice through from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The fervid eloquence of such men as Plunket, Macaulay,
Brougham, and Canning&mdash;"the last of the rhetoricians"&mdash;was
the fruit of many an hour of laborious thought and study.
Canning especially never spared himself. He would draw up
for use in the House a paper, on which were written the
heads of the subjects which he intended to touch upon. These
heads were numbered, and the numbers sometimes extended
to four or five hundred. Lord North, when he lost the thread
of his discourse, would look through his notes with the
utmost nonchalance, seeking the cue which was to lead him
to further flights of eloquence. "It is not on this side of the
paper, Mr. Speaker," he would declaim, still speaking in his
oratorical tone; "neither is it on the other side!" Then,
perhaps, he would suddenly come upon the desired note, and
continue his unbroken oration without a sign of further
hesitation.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Bright used to provide himself with small slips
of paper, inscribed with his bon-mots, which he drew from his
pocket as occasion required. He excelled, nevertheless, in
scathing repartee. Once, during his absence through illness,
a noble lord stated publicly that Bright had been afflicted by
Providence with a disease of the brain as a punishment for
his misuse of his talents. "It may be so," said Bright, on
his return to the House, "but in any case it will be some
consolation to the friends and family of the noble lord to
know that the disease is one which even Providence could
not inflict upon him."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> He did not always get the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
it, however, and when he ridiculed Lord John Manners for
the youthful couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Let wealth and commerce, laws and learning die,</span>
<span class="i0">But leave us still our old nobility!"</span>
</div>

<p>the author justly retorted that he would far sooner be the
foolish young man who wrote those lines than the malignant
old man who quoted them.</p>

<p>That speeches should be as effective when read as when
delivered is the highest quality of oratory. For this reason,
perhaps, some speakers write out their speeches and commit
them to memory. Disraeli did so with his more important
orations, a fact which greatly enhances the pleasure of their
perusal. Macaulay followed the same practice, and, indeed,
it is said that the excessive elaboration of his oratory sometimes
weakened its effect. Lord Randolph Churchill's earlier
speeches were all memorised in this fashion. But it is not
every man whose memory is sufficiently retentive to enable
him to accomplish this feat, and a breakdown in the very
middle of a humorous anecdote thoughtfully interspersed in
a speech is a catastrophe which casts ridicule upon the
speaker.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Though matter may be a most important element in parliamentary
speaking, manner undoubtedly counts for a good deal.
Demosthenes practised declaiming with sharp weapons suspended
above him so as to learn to keep still, and, as we have
already seen, had some obscure reason for filling his mouth with
pebbles. Neither of these practices is to be commended to
modern orators, many of whom already speak as though their
mouths were filled with hot potatoes, while their habitual
gesticulations, if made in the neighbourhood of dependent
cutlery, would result in reducing their bodies to one huge
wound. Sir Watkin Wynne and his brother were long known
in the House of Commons as "Bubble and Squeak," the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
former's voice being a smothered mumble suggestive of
suppressed thunder, the latter's a childish treble. Mannerisms
of gesture, as well as of speech, are easily contracted. Lord
Mahon, "out-roaring torrents in their course," reinforced his
stentorian lungs by violent gestures which were at times a
source of bodily danger to his friends. Once, when speaking
on a Bill he had brought in for the suppression of smuggling,
he declared that this crime must be knocked on the head
with one blow. To emphasize his meaning, he dealt the
unfortunate Pitt, who was sitting just in front of him, a
violent buffet on the head, much to the amusement of the
House.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> The gesticulations of Sir Charles Wetherell, the
well-known member, were less dangerous, if quainter. He
used to unbutton his braces in a nervous fashion while addressing
the House, leaving between his upper and lower garments
an interregnum to which Speaker Manners Sutton once alluded
as the honourable gentleman's only lucid interval. The late
Lord Goschen would grasp himself firmly by the lapel of his
coat, as though (to quote a well-known parliamentary writer)
"otherwise he might run away and leave matters to explain
themselves."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>Parliamentary eloquence to-day makes up in quantity for
what it lacks in quality. The number of members who follow
the advice of the Psalmist and earn a reputation for wisdom
by a continual policy of eloquent silence<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> has dwindled to
vanishing point, since to speak in Parliament has come to be
regarded as part of a member's duty to his constituents.
In Gladstone's first session, in 1833, less than 6000 speeches
were made in the House of Commons; fifty years later the
number had increased to 21,000; to-day the steadily growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
bulk of each volume of the "Parliamentary Debates" testifies
to the swelling flood of oratory which is annually let loose
within the precincts of Parliament. And if La Rochefoucauld's
maxim be true, that we readily pardon those who bore us,
but never those whom we bore, the House of Commons has
need of a most forgiving spirit to listen patiently to so much
of what can only be described as <i>vox et praeterea nihil</i>.</p>

<p>The level of eloquence is, no doubt, higher in the House
of Lords than elsewhere. Peers include a greater number
of orators among their numbers; opportunities for a display
of their talents are more rare; their powers are not
dissipated in prolonged debates, as in the Commons, but
are reserved for full-dress occasions.</p>

<p>In neither House nowadays is there any exhibition of
that old-fashioned rhetoric, florid and flamboyant, which was
once so popular. What Mackintosh calls "an elevated kind
of after-dinner conversation," such as Lord Salisbury affected
so successfully, is the form taken by modern parliamentary
eloquence. There are no appeals to sentiment, no quotations
from the classics, no bombastic declamations.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The House
of Commons is still "a mob of gentlemen, the greater part
of whom are neither without talent nor information,"<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> and
with such an audience learned generalities are out of place.
Passion has to a large extent given way to business, and in
Parliament to-day are rarely heard those "splendid common-places
of the first-rate rhetorician," which Lord Morley
considers necessary to sway assemblies.</p>

<p>We live in a material age. The flowers of rhetoric bloom
no longer in the cold business-like atmosphere of the parliamentary
garden; only the more practical but unromantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
vegetables remain. The rich embroideries of trope and
metaphor have been roughly torn from modern speech,
leaving the bare skeleton of reason exposed to the public
gaze. The grandiose orator of the past, with his ornate
phraseology, his graceful periods, his quotations from the
poets, has been ousted by the passionless debater, flinging,
like the improvident O'Connell, his brood of robust thoughts
into the world, without a rag to cover them. No one to-day
would dream of expending fifty shillings&mdash;let alone fifty
guineas&mdash;for the privilege of hearing a modern Sheridan
address a twentieth-century Parliament; no modern Grattan
(as Sheil might say) shatters the pinnacles of this establishment
with the lightning of his eloquence.</p>

<p>The successful parliamentary speaker is no longer one
who is able, in the words of Macaulay, to produce with
rapidity a series of stirring but transitory impressions, to
excite the minds of five hundred gentlemen at midnight,
without saying anything that any of them will remember
in the morning.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Rather is he the cold judicious politician
who chooses his words less for their beauty than for their
immunity from subsequent perversion, who can crystallise
in a few brief sentences, within the compass of a few minutes,
the opinions that it would have taken his ancestors as many
hours to express in the turgid rhetoric of a bygone age. The
orator&mdash;as the name was once understood&mdash;is now a <i>rara
avis</i>, but seldom raising his tuneful voice above the raucous
cawing of his fellows. And whoever feels with Gibbon that
the great speakers fill him with despair, and the bad ones
with terror, will leave the precincts of Parliament to-day more
often terrorstricken than desperate. That this should be so
is no reason for giving way to gloom or sorrow. Parliamentary
eloquence is not necessarily the sign of a country's
greatness. The English Parliament, which began by acclaiming
Burke as the prince of orators, soon became indifferent to
his powers, and ended by labelling him the "Dinner Bell."
Fox has left no memorial of any good wrought by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
oratory. "Neither the Habeas Corpus Act, nor the Bill of
Rights, nor Magna Charta originated in eloquence," and if
it be true that "a senate of orators is a symptom of material
decay,"<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> we may look forward to the future of England with
calm and perfect confidence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>PARLIAMENT AT WORK&mdash;(1)</h3>


<p>In their efforts to grapple successfully with the ever-increasing
mass of business brought before them, modern
Parliaments show a tendency to prolong their labours to
an ever-increasing extent. Each succeeding session lengthens,
as Macaulay said, "like a human hair in the mouth."</p>

<p>In Tudor times the statutes to be passed were few in
number, and the time occupied in legislation was consequently
short. Members returned by "rotten" boroughs had no
temptation to be prolix; their seats did not depend upon
their parliamentary exertions, and their speeches were therefore
commendably brief. Parliament to-day is often censured
for the sterility of its legislative output, but during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries legislation in the modern
sense of the word scarcely existed at all. Its time was chiefly
spent in the discussion of libellous books and in disputes over
constitutional questions of privilege.</p>

<p>October and November were the months fixed for the
meeting of Parliament in Hanoverian times, and the prorogation
usually took place in April. From 1805 to 1820
it met after Christmas. Since 1820 February has been
the month generally chosen. Nowadays, not only have
the sessions grown much longer&mdash;even the feast of St.
Grouse on the 12th of August is no longer observed by
politicians&mdash;but the hours of each sitting have been considerably
extended. The session of 1847 was prolonged over
293 days; the Parliament of 1852 met on November 4 and
sat until August 20 of the following year, and during the
last two months of that session the House of Commons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
continued sitting for fifteen out of every twenty-four hours.
In 1908, which contained two sessions, the House sat for 253
days, and the session of 1909 lasted from February 16 till
December 3, during the latter weeks of which all-night
sittings were of the commonest occurrence.</p>

<p>In proportion as the daily labours of the Legislature
increased the hour for commencing work became later and
later. In Charles I.'s time Parliament often met as early as
7 a.m., and would sit until twelve, the afternoon being
devoted to the work of the committees.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Later on the hour
of meeting was fixed for 8 or 9 a.m., and the House usually
rose at 4 p.m., or earlier. The Commons always showed the
strongest disinclination to sit in the afternoon, either because
the midday meal did not leave them in a fit condition to
legislate, or because no regular provision was made for lighting
the House when twilight fell. "This council is a grave
council and sober," said a member in 1659, and "ought not
to do things in the dark," and the Speaker would occasionally
regard his inability to distinguish one member from another
as a sufficient excuse for adjourning the House.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The practice
of sitting regularly after dark did not commence until the
year 1717, when, by an order of the House, the Sergeant-at-Arms
was directed to bring in candles as soon as daylight
failed. Prior to that year the employment of artificial light
had to be made the subject of a special motion, and Sergeants
were sometimes reprimanded for providing candles without
the necessary order.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the hours
of sitting varied from time to time. Up to 1888 the House
of Commons sat from 10 a.m. until 3.45 p.m. In that
year the time for meeting was fixed at 3 p.m. and this was
subsequently postponed for an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>Saturday and Sunday have long been recognised as
regular parliamentary holidays, and on one other day in the
week&mdash;either a Wednesday or Friday&mdash;the House of Commons
has adjourned at an earlier hour than usual. This, however,
was not always the case. In Stuart times Parliament sometimes
sat on Sunday and even on Christmas Day,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and it was
on a Sunday&mdash;December 18, 1831&mdash;that the Reform Bill
was read a second time. This, however, was an exceptional
instance, the adjournment over Saturday having been
initiated by Sir Robert Walpole, who, as a keen sportsman,
was always anxious to get away to the country, and believed
that, as Dryden says, it were:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Better to hunt in fields for health unbought,</span>
<span class="i0">Than fee the doctor for his noxious draught."</span>
</div>

<p>In more recent times it became the fashion to adjourn the
House on Derby Day, in order to allow legislators to take
part in the sport of kings. In 1872, this adjournment was
made the subject of a heated debate, and though the division
that ensued resulted in a large majority for the holiday-makers,
the claims of sport gradually gave way to the more
pressing demands of business, and ten years later, when the
Prevention of Crimes (Ireland) Act was under discussion, the
matter was considered too serious to allow of the usual Derby
Day adjournment. The late Sir Wilfrid Lawson once
cynically argued that if the Derby Day became a recognised
official holiday the Speaker of the House of Commons ought
to go to Epsom in his State-coach, "as he did at the thanksgiving
for the Prince of Wales's recovery." The game of
politics is nowadays treated more gravely than ever, and the
most frivolous of modern politicians would scarcely dream of
suggesting that the stern business of Westminster should be
deserted for the pleasures of Epsom Downs. The House of
Lords has always, until a year or two ago, adjourned over
Ash Wednesday and Ascension Day, on the ground that if
they met they would be taken to Church at the Abbey; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
lately they have braved this terror and nothing so serious has
happened.</p>

<p>Prior to 1882 the House of Lords met at five o'clock in the
afternoon; they now meet three-quarters of an hour earlier.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
Except under circumstances of special pressure they take
holidays on Friday and Saturday, and Sunday is, of course,
for them, as for everybody else, a day of complete rest.
Occasionally on other days the amount of work to be
undertaken in the Upper House is so small as to be accomplished
in a few minutes. The Lords, as has been irreverently
observed, often sit scarcely long enough to boil an egg, and it
is only towards the end of the session that they are compelled
to extend their deliberations beyond the dinner-hour.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>The labours of the Commons are more arduous, and entail
longer hours of sitting. On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday the House meets at 2.45 p.m. and continues
sitting until 11 p.m., unless the day's business has been
disposed of before that hour. At eleven o'clock the Speaker
interrupts business, after which no opposed matter can be
dealt with, but, by a Standing Order, it is permissible for a
Minister of the Crown, at the commencement of the day's
work, to move the suspension of the eleven o'clock rule. In
this case no interruption takes place until the business under
discussion is finished.</p>

<p>All-night sittings are not uncommon nowadays, but in
former times they occurred but rarely. In 1742, the Speaker
once sat in the Chair for seventeen hours at a stretch, and
some fifty years later we find the Commons keeping an
occasional all-night vigil. Sir Samuel Romilly left the
House one evening to go to bed, and returned the next
morning to find his colleagues still sitting. He began his
speech by saying that he made no apology for rising to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
address the House at such a time, as seven o'clock was his
usual hour for "getting up."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> In 1877, the Commons sat
for a day and night, and again in 1881, the sitting on the
latter occasion lasting forty-one hours; and since that day
many sittings have been prolonged over the twenty-four
hours. In 1909, the House sat after 1 a.m. o'clock on no less
than thirty-seven occasions, after 4 a.m. on ten occasions, and
once as late as nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Friday is, so to speak, a half-holiday for the Commons.
On that day the House meets at noon, the interruption of
business occurs at five o'clock, and, no matter what subject is
under discussion, the House adjourns at 5.30 p.m. Before
1902, Wednesday was the day chosen for the short sitting,
but the desire of many members to escape from London at
the end of the week led to a change, and it is now possible
for representatives from the most distant parts of England to
pay flying weekly visits to their homes or constituencies.</p>

<p>For a few years recently the House of Commons always
enjoyed an evening interval for dinner, but this agreeable
adjournment was reluctantly sacrificed in 1906, and the
"Speaker's chop" is now nothing but a fragrant memory. The
dinner-hour is much too precious to be wasted at any table
other than that of the House, for at 8.15 on many days any
private business not disposed of at the beginning of the sitting
is given precedence of all else, and what is known as
"opposed" private business is also taken between that hour
and 9.30 p.m.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>For the information of members a daily "notice paper"
is published in two editions&mdash;a blue edition in the
morning, and a white one in the early afternoon&mdash;containing
the orders of the day and all notices of motions.
To this is attached the "votes and proceedings," division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
lists, and an account of the business accomplished at the last
sitting. In the "order book" of the House, also published
daily, is a list of all future business definitely assigned to any
particular sitting; while once a week a catalogue of all
Public Bills that have been introduced, and some report of
their progress, is also included.</p>

<p>By no means the least arduous of the many labours of
Parliament are those which are undertaken by legislators
serving upon the various Committees, of which the public
knows so little, but whose work is very necessary to the
carrying on of public business.</p>

<p>The appointment of Select Committees in both Houses
has been practised ever since the earliest days of Parliament.
The duties of these subsidiary bodies, which may be appointed
for any purpose, are prescribed by the terms of the reference:
they may collect facts for future legislation, investigate
conduct, or examine the terms of a Bill referred to them, thus
saving the time of the House. To them go all opposed
Private Bills, when counsel appear to argue the merits of
clashing interests.</p>

<p>The system of Committees perhaps originated in the
conferences held in former times by the two Houses in the
Painted Chamber. There are records of small deliberative
bodies, somewhat similar in character to the modern Committees,
in the middle of the sixteenth century. By the
time Queen Elizabeth came to the throne such Committees
were common, and were usually composed of members of one
or other House. Select Committees did not exist until the
eighteenth century, and were originally semi-judicial in
character.</p>

<p>All members of the House of Commons are subject to be
called upon to serve on Select Committees, being chosen for
the purpose by a Committee of Selection, and the work thus
done outside the actual Chamber adds considerably to the
daily labours of politicians. No member may refuse to serve,
if called upon to do so, and when, in 1846, Mr. Smith O'Brien
declined to sit on an English Railway Committee, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
confined in the Clock Tower in the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms.</p>

<p>The whole House can also resolve itself at any time into
a Committee, when its function becomes one of "deliberation
rather than inquiry."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Every Public Bill not referred to a
Grand Committee must be considered in a Committee of
the Whole House, and, indeed, the greater part of each
session is occupied by this stage of legislation. The Committee
of Supply and the Committee of Ways and Means
are both "Committees of the Whole House," and are
appointed to discuss the financial projects of the Government,
the one to supervise expenditure, the other to devise
taxation.</p>

<p>A Committee of the Whole House differs in no respect
from the House itself, save that it is presided over by a
chairman in place of the Speaker, and that the mace is
removed from the Table. There are also some changes in
the procedure of debate, as, for example, the cancelling of
the rule forbidding a member to speak twice on the same
question.</p>

<p>The idea of forming the House itself into a committee
has developed, like so many parliamentary institutions,
gradually and almost unconsciously. In days when the
Speaker was too often the spy of the King it was considered
advisable to get rid of him, and this could best be done by
turning the House into a Committee and putting some other
member in the Chair.</p>

<p>The Chairman of Committees in the Lords, and the
Chairman of Ways and Means, or his deputy, in the Commons,
takes the Chair when the House is in Committee, but it is
permissible for either House to nominate any one of their
number as a temporary Chairman.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
As a substitute for Committees of the Whole House in the
Commons, two large Standing Committees, sometimes called
Grand Committees, numbering from sixty to eighty members,
are appointed to consider respectively all Bills relating to Law
and Trade committed to them by the House. Besides the
smaller committees already referred to there are Sessional
Committees, appointed for each session, consisting of from
eight to twelve members&mdash;as, for instance, the committee on
Public Accounts, which meets once a week to look into the
department of the Auditor-General&mdash;which control the
internal arrangements of the House; and joint Committees
of the two Houses, which discuss matters in which both are
interested.</p>

<p>In the Lords also Standing Committees were instituted
in 1889, but these were to supplement and not supersede the
Whole House Committee stage, and after an experience of
more than twenty years have proved their insufficient utility,
they were abolished on June 24, 1910.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century committees generally met
outside the House, in the Star Chamber, in Lincoln's Inn,
or elsewhere, but they have not done so for many years,
numerous committee-rooms being nowadays provided within
the precincts of the House.</p>

<p>At the commencement of every session the House of
Lords elects a Chairman of Committees from among its own
members. His duty it is to preside over Committees of the
Whole House, or over Select Committees on whom the power
of appointing their own Chairman is not expressly conferred.
He is a salaried official of Parliament, and receives a sum
of £2500 a year for his services. Similar duties are undertaken
in the House of Commons by a Chairman of Committees
and a Deputy Chairman, at salaries of £2500 and
£1000 respectively.</p>

<p>The Crown usually appoints by commission one or more
Lords to supply the place of Lord Chancellor, should that
official be unavoidably absent. On emergency it may be
moved that any lord present may be appointed temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to sit Speaker. In the House of Commons the Chairman
of Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairman are similarly
empowered to replace the Speaker when absent.</p>

<p>The problem of providing a substitute for the Speaker
was not settled until 1855, prior to which date no steps
seem to have been taken to fill the Chair in the event of a
Speaker's sudden illness or absence. It appears to have been
considered inadvisable to frame any scheme of relief which
should facilitate his frequent absence. It was, further, the
general sense of the House that no temporary president
could command that implicit acquiescence in the rulings of
the Chair which is so necessary for the maintenance of order
in debate.</p>

<p>To the Chairman of Committees, whom one would regard
as a natural substitute for the Speaker, the House has never
been willing to accord the complete consideration to which
the Chair is entitled; the fact that he is liable at any moment
to sink again into the body of the House robs this official of
much of his authority. In the reign of James I. we find a
Chairman complaining that some member had threatened to
"pull him out of the Chair, that he should put no more tricks
upon the House." And in 1810 another member, Fuller by
name, who had lost the Chairman's eye and his own temper,
called that official a "d&mdash;&mdash; insignificant puppy," and said
that he didn't care a snap of the fingers for him or for the
House either.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The question of replacing the Speaker has, therefore,
always been a delicate one, and for many years no attempt
was made to solve it. In 1656, owing to the illness of Sir
Thomas Widdrington, another member occupied the Chair
for a period of a few weeks, and, during the next few years,
several Speakers complained of ill-health and were temporarily
relieved. From 1547, when the Journals commence, to 1660,
the Speaker was only absent on twelve occasions, and during
the next hundred years the records of the House show only
six cases of absence. The inconvenience caused by the rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
which necessitated an adjournment on such occasions&mdash;curiously
few in number though they were&mdash;can readily be
imagined. On the death of Queen Anne, in 1714, the whole
proceedings of Parliament were delayed, and the sittings
postponed from day to day owing to the Speaker being away
in the country and taking a long time to travel to London.
The duty of being ever in his place at times involved great
hardships. Addington was obliged to take the Chair three
days after the death of his father, persevering by a painful
effort in this stern adherence to the path of duty.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1640, a prolonged session was the cause of
many members absenting themselves from their places in the
House of Commons. In order to ensure a more general
attendance it was then determined that the Speaker should
not take the Chair unless there were at least forty members
present in the House. This rule still holds good, and to-day,
if a quorum of forty is not obtainable before four o'clock, the
sitting is suspended until that hour. Should the same
difficulty arise after four o'clock, the House is adjourned until
the next sitting day.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> An exception is made in favour of
the hour between 8.15 and 9.15, but if a division be taken
during that hour in the absence of a quorum, the business
in debate must be postponed and the next business brought
on. When, too, a message from the Crown is delivered, the
House of Commons is held to be "made" even though forty
members are not present. On such an occasion the business
of the day can be proceeded with so long as no notice is
taken of the absence of a quorum.</p>

<p>It is not the Speaker's (or Chairman's) duty to notice
the absence of a quorum, but if his attention is drawn to it
by a member he must at once rise in his place and proceed
to count the House. There is a well-known story of a prolix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
member speaking to empty benches in the Commons who
referred sarcastically to the packed audience hanging upon
his words, and was interrupted by the Speaker, who at once
proceeded to "count out" the House, and put an end to the
sitting as well as to the member's oration. The Speaker's
inability to count the House out of his own accord has
occasionally given rise to inconvenient situations. Lord
George Gordon once rose and requested permission to read
from a book, which was granted. He then proceeded to
read the Bible until the House dwindled from upwards of
four hundred members to two, namely, the Speaker and
Lord George himself, who had the indecency to keep the
former in the Chair till the candles were "fairly in the
socket."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>In the House of Lords three peers form a quorum. If,
however, thirty lords are not present on a division upon
any stage of a Bill, the question is declared to be not decided,
and the debate is adjourned until the next sitting. Lord
Rosebery, in 1884, recalled an occasion when a noble lord,
Lord Leitrim, addressed a quorum of the House, consisting,
besides himself, of the Lord Chancellor and the Minister
whose duty it was to answer him, for four mortal hours.
Another instance of the same kind is supposed to have
occurred when Lord Lyndhurst was on the Woolsack and
a noble lord spoke at considerable length to an audience of
even smaller proportions. After a time the Chancellor
became very weary and could scarcely conceal his impatience.
"This is too bad," he said at length, "can't you stop?" Still,
the peer prosed on, showing no sign of reaching his peroration.
Finally, Lyndhurst could stand it no longer. "By
Jove," he cried, suddenly inspired with a brilliant idea, "I
will count you out!" As he and the speaker only were
present in the House at the time, the Chancellor was able
to do this, and the long-winded nobleman was effectually
silenced.</p>

<p>In early times the daily sittings of Parliament were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
preceded by Mass held in St. Stephen's Chapel. Later on it
became the custom for the lords to repair to the Abbey, and
the Commons to St. Margaret's Church, for a brief morning
service. In the Parliaments of Queen Elizabeth the Litany
was read daily, and a short prayer offered up by the Speaker
at the meeting of the House. Prior to 1563, no regular daily
prayers were held, but on the first five days of any Parliament
"an archbishop, bishop or famous clerk, discrete and
eloquent," preached to the House.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> This practice long continued,
and we read of "Dr. Burgesse and Master Marshal,"
preaching to Parliament on a fast day in the year 1640 for
"at least seven hours betwixt them"<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>&mdash;an occasion when
their eloquence seems to have outrun their discretion.</p>

<p>Nineteen years later Richard Cromwell appointed the
first regular chaplain to relieve the Speaker and the discreet
and eloquent prelates and clerks of their duties. This official
enjoyed no fixed emoluments, but was upheld and nourished
by the consciousness of duty nobly done and the hope of
subsequent preferment. His counterpart to-day is appointed
by the Speaker and paid by the House, and his duties consist
in reading the three brief prayers with which each daily
session of the House commences.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> In the Lords this task is
undertaken by the bishops in rotation.</p>

<p>When prayers are over in the Lower House any "private
business" that has to be taken is called on, and Private Bills
pass through the initiatory stages of their career. The procedure
in this case is, as a rule, purely formal, and lasts but a
short time.</p>

<p>The dispatch of private business is immediately followed
by the oral presentation of petitions by those members who
have informed the Speaker of their intention to do so.</p>

<p>In these days of open courts of justice, a free Press, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
wholesale publicity the need for petitions is not so great as
it was in times when the voice of the people could not
always obtain a hearing. To-day the papers are only too
ready to lend their columns to the airing of any grievance,
real or imaginary, and politicians are not unwilling to make
party capital out of any individual instances of apparent
injustice or oppression that may be brought to their notice.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago all petitions were read to the House
by the members presenting them, and lengthy discussions
often ensued. Much waste of time resulted from this practice,
and the frequent arrival at Westminster of large bodies of
petitioners caused great inconvenience, and sometimes led to
rioting. In 1641, a huge crowd of women completely blocked
the entrance of the House. They were led by a certain Mrs.
Anne Stagg, "a gentlewoman and brewer's wife," and their
object was to present a petition directed against the Popish
bishops.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The Sergeant of the Parliamentary Guard appealed
to the House for advice as to how he should treat these
women, and was told to speak them fair and send them away.
This he accordingly proceeded to do, but not without much
difficulty.</p>

<p>Two years later three thousand other "mean women,"
wearing white ribbons in their hats, arrived at Westminster
with another petition. "Peace! Peace!" they cried, in a
manner which was little calculated to gain that which they
were seeking. "Give us those traitors that are against peace,
that we may tear them to pieces! Give us that dog Pym!"
The conduct of these viragoes at length became so unruly
that the trained bands were sent for, and the order was
eventually given to fire upon the mob. "When the gentle
sex can so flagrantly renounce their character, and make
such formidable attacks on the men," says a contemporary
historian, "they certainly forfeit the polite treatment due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
them as women"&mdash;and in this case their forgetfulness cost
them the loss of several lives.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>To-day, under the provisions of the One Mile Act of
George III.&mdash;the result of an attack made upon the Regent
on his way from the opening of Parliament in 1817&mdash;no
assembly of petitioners or public meeting is allowed within a
mile of the Palace of Westminster. Petitions themselves are
treated in a summary manner which permits of little time
being wasted. No debate is permitted upon the subjects
raised by petitions, and the formal method of presentation
has given place to a more satisfactory (if somewhat perfunctory)
fashion of dealing with them.</p>

<p>Behind the Speaker's Chair hangs a large bag. In this a
petition may be placed, at any time during a sitting, by the
member in charge of it. Thence it is sent to the Committee
on Public Petitions, and presumably never heard of again.
Petitions sometimes contain so many signatures, and are
consequently so bulky, that no earthly bag could possibly
contain them. In 1890, for instance, a petition eight miles in
length, in favour of the Local Taxation Bill, was presented to
Parliament, and in 1908 another, almost as voluminous,
provided a material protest against the Licensing Bill.
Petitions of such proportions are carried into the House on
the shoulders of stout officials, and, after reposing for a brief
space upon the floor, are presently borne away to be no more
seen or remembered.</p>

<p>When petitions have been disposed of, motions for unopposed
returns are taken, and other formal business; and
then follows question-time, perhaps one of the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
hours of the parliamentary day, when a hitherto languid
House begins to take some interest in the proceedings.</p>

<p>Politicians would appear to be among the most inquisitive
individuals on the face of the globe; their thirst for general
information is as insatiable as it is amazing. The time spent
by various Government officials in pandering to this craving
for knowledge on the part of legislators is very considerable:
it has even been hinted that the clerks at the Irish Office are
employed exclusively upon the task of answering conundrums
set by members of the House of Commons. Nothing is too
insignificant, no matter is too sacred, to be made the subject
of a question in the House. But, although any member has
a perfect right to apply for a return, or to ask any question he
pleases, within certain bounds, a Minister of the Crown may
always refuse to supply the return, or decline to answer the
question; nor need he give any reason for so doing. This
rule provides a loophole for a Minister who is confronted with
an awkward question to which it would need the powers of
subtlety and casuistry of a Gladstone to find a non-committal
reply.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>A member of Lord Aberdeen's Ministry in 1854 was
attacked for not rendering a certain return that had been
applied for. He made no comment at the time, but on a
subsequent occasion produced and laid on the Table of the
House a huge folio volume weighing 1388 lbs. and containing
seventy-two reams of foolscap. The compilation of this
return, as he informed the House, had caused the dispatch
of 34,500 circular letters and the cataloguing and tabulating
of 34,500 replies. The result of the figures mentioned therein
had not been arrived at, the Minister went on to explain, as
it would have taken two clerks a whole year to add them up.
Further, he added, the return, if completed, would afford no
information beyond that which the House already possessed.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Ever since 1902, a written instead of an oral reply can be
rendered to all questions that are not marked with an asterisk
by the member who asks them. No questions may be asked
after a certain hour, and the answers to those that have not
been reached at that hour, as well as to those that are not
marked with an asterisk, are printed and circulated, thus
saving a great deal of valuable time.</p>

<p>Questions must be brief and relevant. No member may
ask an excessive or unreasonable number, nor may he couch
them in lengthy terms. They may not be framed argumentatively
nor contain personal charges against individuals. The
Speaker is empowered to disallow any question if he thinks
fit, and often interposes to check supplementary questions
which are not relevant, or which constitute an abuse of the
right to interrogate Ministers; and the latter are always at
liberty to refuse an answer on the grounds that a reply
would be contrary to the public interest. Whenever our
relations with foreign Powers are in any way strained,
certain members seem to take a delight in asking questions
calculated to hamper the movements of the Foreign Office,
or to provide other nations with all the secret information
they desire. And it is not always expedient or easy for
Ministers to refuse to satisfy the thirst for knowledge of their
friends or opponents, or to try and choke off the inquisitive
or importunate with evasive answers. It was always said
that "Darby Griffith destroyed Lord Palmerston's first
Government," by asking perpetual questions which the Premier
answered with a "cheerful impertinence which hurt his parliamentary
power."<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> And the amount of patience and tact
displayed by modern Ministers in replying to frivolous or
petty queries is always a subject of admiration to the
stranger.</p>

<p>Members no doubt feel it their duty to provide their
constituencies with some material evidence of their parliamentary
labours, and no easier method can be imagined than
the asking of questions on subjects in which they possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
take not the slightest interest. Some politicians openly
confess that their secretaries have orders to make out a
regular weekly list of conundrums which they can hurl at the
heads of unoffending Ministers, with no other purpose than
that of showing their constituents that they are taking an
active interest in the affairs of the nation. The criticism
made by a parliamentary writer fifty years ago is equally
applicable to-day. "It would seem to be the chief amusement
of some members diligently to read the newspapers in
the morning, and to ask Ministers of State in the afternoon
if they have read them too, and what they think of them."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>The growth of this yearning for information is very
clearly shown by a glance at the parliamentary statistics for
the last hundred years. In 1800 not a single question was
put during the whole of one session. In 1846 the number
of questions asked with due notice was sixty-nine. In 1850
the number had risen to 212, in 1888 to 5000; in 1901 over
7000 questions were put, and to-day the number is still
steadily increasing.</p>

<p>At four o'clock, or earlier if questions have been disposed
of, the House proceeds to the consideration of its public
business and the "orders of the day," and the real business
of Parliament begins.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>PARLIAMENT AT WORK (II)</h3>


<p>The modern system of legislating by Bill and Statute
dates from the reign of Henry VI. In earlier days
legislation was effected by means of humble petitions
presented to the Crown by the Commons, and granted or
refused according as the King thought fit.</p>

<p>Every Act of Parliament commences its existence in the
shape of a Bill. As such, it may be introduced in either
House, though the Commons have the undoubted monopoly
of initiating financial measures, and Bills for the restitution of
honours and blood must originate with the Lords. In the
Upper House, any peer may introduce a Bill without notice,
but in the Commons a member must give notice of his intention
either to present a measure or move for leave to do so.
A Bill whose main object is to impose a charge upon the
public revenue must first be authorized by a resolution of a
Committee of the Whole House.</p>

<p>Bills may be roughly classified under the two headings of
Public and Private, according as they affect the general
interest or are framed for the benefit of individuals or groups
of individuals, though there also exist hybrid Bills which
cannot be rightly placed in either category. But whatever
their nature, Bills must pass through five successive stages.
In the House of Lords, however, the Committee and Report
stages are occasionally negatived in the case of Money Bills,
and the Committee stage of Private Bills is conducted outside
the House either before the Chairman of Committees or, in
case of opposition, by a Select Committee of the House.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>In ancient days the proceedings were not so lengthy as
they afterwards became, a Bill being sometimes read three
times and passed in a single day;<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> but nowadays the passage
through Parliament of a Controversial Bill is a tedious affair.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient for the purposes of this chapter to take
the example of a Public Bill introduced in the House of
Commons, and follow it from its embryonic state along the
course of its career until, as an Act of Parliament, it finally
takes its place in the statute-book of the land.</p>

<p>By obtaining the permission of the House, a Member of
Parliament may bring in a Bill upon any conceivable subject,
but it is not always possible for him to find the necessary
opportunity for doing so, unless he happens to be exceptionally
favoured by fortune.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> In these days, when the time at the
disposal of Parliament is altogether inadequate to the demands
made upon it by legislation, the chances of passing a Bill
without the support of the Government are for a private
member extremely small. Even with official assistance this
is not always an easy matter. It is perhaps as well that the
passion for legislation latent in the bosom of every politician
should to some extent be curbed. George II. said to Lord
Waldegrave that Parliament passed nearly a hundred laws
every session, which seemed made for no other purpose than
to afford people the pleasure of breaking them, and his
opinion that the less legislation effected by Parliament the
better for the country is still popular in many quarters.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>On the third day of every session the question of the
priority of members' claims to introduce Bills and motions is
decided by ballot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>A member who is lucky, and has, if necessary, obtained
the leave of the House, can introduce his Bill briefly and
without debate. Taking his stand at the bar, he awaits the
summons of the Speaker, when, advancing to the Table, he
hands to the Clerk a "dummy" on which the title of the
Bill is written. This the Clerk proceeds to read to the House.
The Bill is then considered to have been read a first time, and
ordered to be printed, and a day is fixed for the Second
Reading.</p>

<p>The First Reading is looked upon as a mere matter of form,
and rarely opposed.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> It is on the Second Reading, when the
principle of the Bill is by way of being discussed, that any
real antagonism begins to make itself felt. Opponents may
negative the motion that the Bill be <i>now</i> read a second time&mdash;in
which case the motion may be repeated another day&mdash;or
may adopt the more usual and polite method of moving that
the Bill be read "this day six (or three) months"&mdash;the intention
being to destroy the Bill by postponing the Second
Reading until after the prorogation of Parliament. No Bill
or motion on which the House has given such a decision may
be brought up again during the same session, so that a postponement
of the reading is merely a courteous way of
shelving it altogether.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>A Bill that has successfully weathered a Second Reading
stands committed to a Committee of the Whole House, unless
the House, on motion, resolves that it be referred to some
other kind of Committee, viz., a Grand Committee, a Select
Committee, or a Joint Committee of both Houses.</p>

<p>When the House is to resolve itself into Committee a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
motion to that effect is made in the Lords, to which an
amendment may be moved; in the Commons the Speaker
leaves the chair, and the Chairman of Committees at once
presides, sitting in the Clerk's chair at the Table. The Bill
is then discussed clause by clause, and any number of amendments
may be proposed to each line, and any number of
speeches made by any member on each amendment. No
limit is set to the number of amendments that may be
moved, provided they are relevant and consistent with the
policy of the Bill. This is therefore by far the most lengthy
stage of the Bill, and it was in order to accelerate the progress
of business that, in 1883, Standing Committees, consisting
of from sixty to eighty members, were created to
which Bills relating to Law and Trade were to be referred
instead of to the Committee of the Whole House.</p>

<p>When the Bill has passed through the Committee stage,
it is reported to the House with or without amendments.
In the former case, a day is fixed for the discussion of its
altered shape, and on this "Report" stage further amendments
may be made. At the Third Reading a Bill may still
be rejected, or postponed "for six months," or re-committed,
but in the Commons no material amendments may be made
to it. This stage is usually taken at once after the Report;
but in the Lords the two stages must be on different days, and
amendments may be made after due notice on the Third
Reading.</p>

<p>When a Bill has safely passed all its stages in the Lower
House, the Clerk of the Commons attaches to it a polite
message in Norman-French&mdash;"soit baillé aux seigneurs"&mdash;and
hands it to his colleague in the Lords. The latter lays
it on the Table of the Upper House, where it lies until taken
up by some peer&mdash;which must be done within twelve sitting
days, if the Bill is not to be lost (though it may be raised
from the dead by notice of a motion to revive it of the same
duration)&mdash;when its subsequent treatment, with the few
differences noted above, is very similar to that which it has
already undergone.</p>

FROM AN ENGRAVING AFTER THE PAINTING BY SIR J. REYNOLDS</span>
</div>

<p>Should the Lords pass a Bill as it stands, a message to
that effect is sent to the Commons. If, however, they have
made alterations, the Clerk of the Parliaments writes, "A
ceste bille avesque des amendemens les seignieurs sont
assentus" across it, and returns it to the Clerk of the other
House.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> The Commons then proceed to consider the Lords'
amendments on some future day. If the two Houses cannot
agree, they must either summon a Conference&mdash;nowadays
an unusual step to take<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>&mdash;or a Select Committee of the
dissenting House sends a specially prepared message to
the other Chamber, explaining the reasons for its disagreement.
Numerous messages may pass in this way, for the
purpose of coming to an agreement; but if they fail, the Bill
is lost for the Session.</p>

<p>When a Bill has passed both Houses, nothing remains but
to give it the Royal Assent, which is done by the Clerk of
the Parliaments.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
The Royal Assent is nowadays a mere formality&mdash;a final
ceremonial which marks the last stage of a Bill's progress
ere it becomes law. It is usually given by the Lords Commissioners,
who act as representatives of the Crown, though
there is nothing to prevent a sovereign from performing
this duty himself. On August 2, 1831, when the Bill
making separate financial provision for Queen Adelaide
received the Royal Assent, both the King and Queen
attended in Parliament, and the latter acknowledged her
indebtedness by bowing thrice, presumably to King, Lords
and Commons. As a rule, however, the sovereign is not
present on these occasions, his place being taken by a Commission.
This consists of the Lord Chancellor and two
other Lords, who take their seats, prior to the ceremony,
upon a form placed between the Throne and the Woolsack.
The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded
to summon the faithful Commons, and, on the arrival of the
latter at the bar of the Lords, the titles of the various Bills
are read aloud by the Clerk of the Crown, and the Royal Assent
is given by the Clerk of the Parliaments in old-fashioned
Norman-French. In the case of a Money Bill, brought up
by the Speaker of the Commons, and received by the Clerk
of the Parliaments, who bears it to the Table bowing, the
formula runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Le Roi remerçie ses bons sujets, accepte leur benevolence,
et ainsi le veult."</p>

<p>In the case of a Public or Private Bill, the respective
phrases, "Le Roi le veult" or "Soit fait comme il est
désiré" are substituted, though, as a matter of practice, the
latter phrase is only used for Estate, Naturalisation and
Divorce Bills.</p>

<p>In olden days, when the Crown was often in the habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of refusing to consent to the passing of particular Bills, the
words used by the Clerk of the Parliaments to signify the
royal veto were "Le Roi s'avisera." In this way Queen
Elizabeth quashed no less than forty-eight Bills that had
passed through Parliament, and William III. similarly
declined to assent to the Parliamentary Proceedings Bill
of 1693, much to the annoyance of the Commons. But
never since Queen Anne vetoed the Scotch Militia Bill, in
1707, has any sovereign refused the Royal Assent.</p>

<p>All questions before Parliament are decided by the voice
of the majority. And though, as Gladstone once said, decision
by majorities may be as much an expedient as lighting by
gas, it is an expedient that answers very well in practice,
and for which an effective substitute has yet to be found.
Majority may sometimes seem a clumsy argument, but it
always remains "the best repartee."</p>

<p>The procedure in either House for ascertaining the
general opinion upon any measure or motion differs but
slightly in form, and not at all in principle. At the end of
every debate the question under discussion is laid before the
House by its Speaker or Chairman. This he does by rising
in his place and saying, "The question is that ..." (here
follows the exact words of the motion). "As many as are of
that opinion say 'Aye!'; as many as are of the contrary
opinion say 'No!'" (In the Lords the words "Content"
and "Not Content" are substituted for "Aye" and "No.")
Members or peers thereupon express their views in the
required manner, and the Speaker (or Chairman), gathering
what is called the "sense of the House" by the volume of
sound proceeding from either party, says, "I think the
Ayes (or Noes)"&mdash;or, in the Lords "the Contents" or "Not
Contents"&mdash;"have it!"</p>

<p>If the judgment of the Chair be unchallenged, the question
is deemed to be resolved in the affirmative or negative, as
the case may be, and nothing further remains to be done.
Should, however, either party question the correctness of the
Chairman's opinion, recourse is had to a division, and certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
necessary formalities have to be observed before the matter
is definitely settled one way or the other.</p>

<p>When a division is challenged in the House of Commons,
the Speaker (or Chairman) orders the Sergeant-at-Arms to
"Clear the lobby," and the tellers' doors leading from the
lobbies, as well as the door leading from the Central Hall,
are immediately locked. After the lapse of two minutes,
during which the loud division-bells are set ringing all over
the building to summon breathless members to the Chamber,
the question is again put from the Chair. If once more
challenged, the Speaker names two members of either party
to act as "tellers." Should no one be found willing to
undertake this duty, a division cannot take place, and the
Speaker declares that the "Noes" have it. If, however,
tellers are duly appointed, they take their place at the exit
doors leading from the two lobbies, which are now unlocked.
After another interval, this time of four minutes' duration,
the doors leading from the House to the lobbies are locked.
Meanwhile, all members who wish to vote have left the
Chamber, and are streaming through their respective lobbies,
where their names are recorded by clerks, while the tellers
count them as they pass through the lobby doors.</p>

<p>In the old days of St Stephen's Chapel, the "Ayes" used
to remain in the House, while the "Noes" withdrew, and
were counted on their return. This practice led to endless
difficulties, many members refusing to go out for fear of
losing their seats, while others were forcibly detained by their
friends. In Elizabeth's time, Sir Walter Raleigh admitted
that he often held a fellow-member by his sleeve, and others
were accused of pulling each other back, as Cecil said, "like
a dog on a string."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Later on, it was decided that members
who gave their votes for the introduction of "any new
matter" should alone withdraw, while the votes of those who
remained behind were recorded. This system also had its
disadvantages. In 1834, for instance, when a certain Whig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
member, Colonel Evans, fell asleep in one of the side galleries
during a division, he woke to find that he had been counted
among the Tories, much to his disgust. Finally, two years
later, the practice of clearing the House altogether for a
division was first instituted, and continued in force until the
establishment of the modern method in 1906.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>When all members who desire to vote have filed through
the lobbies, and are once more reassembled in the House, the
four tellers advance together to the Table. The senior teller
of the party having a majority, walks on the right, bearing in
his hand a slip of paper, on which are written the numbers
of the division. By the position of the teller it is thus
possible to gauge the result of a division before it has been
officially announced, and his advance to the Table in the
place of honour is usually the signal for an outburst of cheering
from his own victorious party. He proceeds to report
the result of the division to the Clerk at the Table, who
writes the numbers on a piece of paper, which he hands back
to him. This the teller passes to the Speaker, who, in turn,
announces the numbers to the House. The doors are then
unlocked, and the division is at an end.</p>

<p>On one famous occasion the tellers failed to agree in their
reports of the figures. This happened on May 10, 1675,
when the House in Committee had divided on a motion with
regard to the English regiments serving in the French army.
The tellers' difference of opinion gave rise to a scene of great
confusion, during which one member spat in another's face,
and a free fight would probably have ensued but for the
sudden arrival of the Speaker.</p>

<p>The amount of time spent in dividing has always been
a source of annoyance to earnest politicians, more especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
when divisions are made use of as a recognised form of
obstruction, and the progress of parliamentary business
thereby much impeded. In 1902, to name a recent example,
the opponents of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, which had
already passed a Second Reading, deliberately walked so
slowly through the lobbies during four divisions that there
was no time left to move that it should be sent to a Grand
Committee. Members naturally grudge the precious hours
wasted in trudging through the lobbies; but it seems impossible
to invent any scheme that shall further expedite
matters, the present system being apparently as perfect as
the mind of man can devise.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>When a division is called in the House of Lords, the
procedure is very similar in character to that of the Commons.
The Chancellor (or Lord on the Woolsack) orders strangers
to withdraw by saying, "Clear the bar!" and the Clerk of
the Parliaments thereupon turns a two-minute sand-glass.</p>

<p>When the sand has run out of the glass, the doors are
locked, and the question is once more put to the House.
If the Lord Chancellor's decision is challenged he at once
says, "the 'Contents' will go to the right by the Throne,
and the 'Not Contents' to the left by the bar." Each party
then passes through its own lobby, the "Contents" re-entering
the House on the right of the bar, the "Not Contents"
through the door on the left of the Throne, their votes being
duly recorded by clerks in the lobbies. The subsequent
procedure resembles that in vogue in the Lower House.</p>

<p>Until 1857, when the present system was adopted, the
"Contents" remained within the bar, while the "Not Contents"
went below the bar. Peers, who through infirmity,
or other causes, are disabled from leaving the House, may by
its permission be "told" in their seats, and those who do not
wish to vote at all are allowed to go within the railings on
the steps of the Throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>In old days the practice of voting by proxy was habitual
in the House of Lords. During the reign of Edward I.,
nobles who were unable to attend in person invariably sent
messengers to act for them. Peers were permitted to appoint
any individuals to represent them, either permanently or on
special occasions, and, up to the fifteenth century, these
proxies did not even have to be peers themselves. In the
time of Henry VIII. the custom of allowing peers to represent
one another was first instituted, and in Charles I.'s day
we find the Duke of Buckingham holding no less than
fourteen proxies. Such a custom naturally led to many
abuses, and an order was eventually passed forbidding any
peer to hold more than two proxies. Finally, in 1868, the
House of Lords realised that the practice was reprehensible,
and passed a Standing Order whereby the system of calling
for proxies on a division was discontinued.</p>

<p>To-day, peers are in some ways even more particular than
their colleagues in the Commons, and do not allow any one
of their number to take part in a division unless he has himself
been in the House when the question was put. In other
respects they enjoy a wider latitude. If a lord occasionally
strays into the wrong lobby, he may refuse to be counted by
the tellers, and his vote may afterwards be recorded as he
desires. A member of the House of Commons who commits
a like indiscretion is required to bear the consequences, and
can neither alter nor rescind his vote.</p>

<p>In the event of an equal number of votes being recorded
on either side in a division the procedure differs in the two
Houses. In the Lords the question is invariably resolved in
the negative, in accordance with the ancient rule of the Law:
"semper præsumitur pro negante." In the Commons the
Speaker has to decide it by a casting vote, which he generally
gives in such a manner as to leave the question open for
another division. This, however, is not always an easy task;
indeed, it is often a most invidious and unpleasant one. In
April, 1805, Speaker Abbot was compelled to give a casting-vote
on the resolution leading to the impeachment of Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Melville. After ten minutes' distressing hesitation, while
the House remained in a state of agonized suspense, Abbot
reluctantly gave his vote against Lord Melville, and thus
secured the defeat of Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>This is by no means the only instance of a momentous
question such as the life of a Government being decided by a
single vote. The Second Reading of the Reform Bill in
1831 was carried by a majority of one; the House on that
occasion presenting a sight which, as Macaulay said, was to
be seen only once and never to be forgotten. "It was like
seeing Cæsar stabbed in the Senate House, or seeing Oliver
taking the mace from the Table." When the tellers announced
the majority the victorious party shouted with joy, while
some of them actually shed tears. "The jaw of Peel fell;
and the face of Twiss was as the face of a damned soul; and
Herries looked like Judas taking his necktie off for the last
operation." In 1854 Lord Russell was defeated and Sir
Robert Peel returned to victory on the crest of an equally
diminutive wave; and a century earlier Walpole's administration
was overthrown by a small majority of three.</p>

<p>A minority of one is more unusual, but not altogether
unknown. At the end of the eighteenth century, when the
Duke of Somerset divided the House of Lords on a question
of war with France, he walked alone into the Opposition
division lobby. The same fate befell Dr. Kenealy in 1875,
when his motion on behalf of the Tichborne Claimant was
defeated by 433 votes to 1. On July 16, 1909, when a
division was taken on an amendment to reject a Bill prohibiting
foreign trawlers from landing their catches at British
ports, the Noes numbered 158 while there was but a solitary
Aye. And on July 18, 1910, on a motion for the adjournment
of the House, there was but a single No.</p>

<p>No secrecy is maintained as to the voting of peers or
members in divisions. In the old Journals of the Lords the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
division lists used always to be entered, but in 1641 this
practice was abandoned, and the minority could only record
an adverse vote by a formal protest of dissent.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Division
lists were not regularly printed in the Commons until 1836,
and the Lords followed suit about twenty years later.</p>

<p>Divisions provide legislators with plenty of exercise, combined
occasionally with acute mental anxiety. The latter
they share with those hardworked and hardworking individuals,
the "Whips" or "Whippers-in," whose duties are at
all times heavy and become especially onerous with the
approach of a division.</p>

<p>These Whips, who are four in number&mdash;two representing
the Government, two the Opposition&mdash;have rooms provided
for them in the Lobby, and hold positions of the utmost
responsibility and influence. In the House of Commons the
office of principal Government Whip is one of immense
importance and requires, as Disraeli said, "consummate
knowledge of human nature, the most amiable flexibility, and
complete self-control."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> As Patronage Secretary to the
Treasury, with a salary of £2000 a year, he is the descendant
of that official, sometimes known as the "Secretary for
Political Jobs," who in former times bought members, their
votes and constituencies, and disposed of the Government
secret service money to obtain (and retain) a majority for the
party in power.</p>

<p>The Chief Whip is generally assisted by two of the Junior
Lords of the Treasury, and, in conjunction with the Opposition
Whips, arranges all the details of the sessional campaign.
On the occasion of important debates the Whips conspire to
choke off any garrulous nonentities who may wish to make
their voices heard, and practically arrange a list of the
influential speakers on both sides in the order in which they
are to address the House. At such a time the Speaker's eye
may almost be said to be a party to the conspiracy, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
never yielding its discretion to be caught by members whose
names are not upon the Whips' list.</p>

<p>Tact, good temper and unceasing vigilance are virtues
necessary to Whips. They must combine the discretion
of the diplomatist with the acumen of the sleuth-hound.
It is their business to smooth the ruffled feathers of
any members who consider themselves aggrieved, to listen
patiently to the bores, to suffer the fools gladly. They
are expected to ascertain the "sense" of the House
upon all important questions, either by instinct, by worming
their way into the confidence of members, or by secret
detective work in the Smoking Room. They must keep
their leader informed of their discoveries, and thus guard the
party against any sudden unexpected attack. If necessary
they act as emissaries or ambassadors between the party
heads, arranging an occasional compromise or deciding what
particular questions shall be discussed in an uncontroversial
spirit.</p>

<p>The Whips have been called the autocrats of the House
of Commons, but though they rule individual members with
an iron hand, it must ever be their desire to keep their party
contented and happy and harmonious. When a private
member is very anxious to escape from the House for a
holiday it is to the Whip he applies for permission. If
possible he "pairs" with some member on the other side who
is equally desirous of escaping. At the door of the House lies
a book in which members "pairing" with one another inscribe
their names, and it is one of the Whips' duties to arrange
these "pairs," and, above all, to see that no member gets
away unpaired.</p>

<p>At a time when a ticklish division is expected, when the
majority on either side is uncertain, the Whips are stimulated
to herculean labours. Threats, entreaties, cajoleries, all must
be employed to bring members up to the scratch. The
waverers must be secured, the doubtful reassured. Nothing
can be left undone to ensure that every available member
shall be in his place when the decisive moment arrives. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
byways and hedges are scoured for absentees, who are
besought to return at once to Westminster to record their
votes and perhaps save their party from defeat.</p>

<p>When Pulteney, whom Macaulay considered the greatest
leader of the Opposition that the House of Commons had
ever seen, gathered his forces in 1742 to overthrow Walpole,
the Opposition left no stone unturned to ensure a majority.
They collected every man of the party, no matter what
excuses he put forward. One was brought into the House in
a dying condition, but contrived to defer his impending
dissolution until he had recorded his valuable vote. Both
sides produced a number of incurables, and the House
looked (as Ewald says) more like the Pool of Bethesda than
a legislative assembly. The Prince of Wales was an
interested spectator of the scene. "I see," he remarked to
General Churchill, "you bring in the lame, the halt and the
blind!" "Yes," replied the General, "the lame on our side,
the blind on yours!"<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>A similar scene took place in 1866 when the Russell-Gladstone
Cabinet was defeated over the Reform Bill. The
Whips had achieved wonders in collecting their flocks
together; they had haled to Westminster the sick, the senile,
the decrepit, the doting and the moribund. The grave alone
seems to have been sacred from their ravages. Some of the
members, as we read in a contemporary account, "had been
wooed from the prostration of their couches; one had been
taken from the delights of his marriage-trip; and several
from the bedsides of relatives in extremity."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>To be able to accomplish such feats the Whips must be
well acquainted with the habits and haunts of the individuals
beneath their charge, so that at any moment of the day or
night they may send a telegram or a message to an absentee
whose presence is urgently required. Pepys in his Diary
(December 8, 1666) describes how the King gave an order
"to my Lord Chamberlain to send to the playhouses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
brothels, to bid all the Parliament-men that were there to go
to the Parliament presently," to vote against some Bill of
which he disapproved. The modern Whip in like manner
must be ready at any moment to despatch an urgent
summons to the Opera, to the Clubs, to houses where parties
are being given, recalling members to their parliamentary
duties. And in doing so he must exercise the greatest
possible tact. The wife of a much respected member of
Parliament was sleeping peacefully in her bed one night
when a frantic message arrived from the party Whip
imploring her husband to come at once to Westminster.
She remembered that her spouse had informed her that he
would probably be kept at the House until late and had
begged her not to sit up. Inspired with horrible suspicions
of conjugal perfidy, the good lady rose in haste and hurried
down to the House of Commons to confirm them. As a
matter of fact her husband had never left the precincts of
Parliament, and the Whip's message had been despatched in
error. The member was therefore much surprised at the
sudden appearance of his wife upon the scene. His attachment
to home and duty had been equally unimpaired, and he
received her explanation somewhat coldly.</p>

<p>A notice, more or less heavily underlined, is sent to each
member of Parliament every morning, apprising him of the
business of the day's sitting and of the necessity for his
presence in the House. These "whips," as they are called,
were in vogue as long ago as the year 1621, when, Porritt
tells us, notices underlined six times were sent to the King's
friends.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> The urgency of the summons can be gauged by the
number of underlines, and a "whip" that is underlined three
times can only be ignored at the peril of the member who
receives it.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>Though the Whips seldom address the House themselves,
they must on all occasions be ready to provide other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
speakers who shall feed the dying embers of debate with
fresh fuel. At all hazards the ball must be kept rolling.
Sometimes a debate shows signs of languishing in an unexpected
fashion, and the Whip is horrified to find that his
usual majority has dwindled away to nothing. When this
occurs he must at once find members who are willing to talk
against time while he and his colleagues hasten round and
beat up a majority. On one famous occasion within recent
memory, while most of the supporters of the Conservative
Government were disporting themselves at Ascot on the
Cup day, the Opposition prepared to spring an unexpected
division upon the House. The situation was only saved
by Mr. Chaplin, who spoke for several hours, in spite of the
howls of his opponents, while a special train was bringing
absentees from the racecourse to the House of Commons.</p>

<p>It is, then, the Whip's duty, not only to "make" a House
and to "keep" a House, but also, like Sidmouth's sycophantic
relatives, to "cheer the Minister." To quote the lines of
Canning&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>STRANGERS IN PARLIAMENT</h3>


<p>Theoretically speaking, Parliament is averse to
the presence of strangers; in practice both Houses
are as hospitably inclined as is compatible with the
limited space at their disposal.</p>

<p>One of the chief duties of the Sergeant-at-Arms originally
consisted in "taking into custody such strangers who presume
to come into the House of Commons."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> This duty has
however, long been neglected, and a modern Sergeant-at-Arms
who sought to accomplish such a task would find his hands
full.</p>

<p>In the early days of Parliament, the most drastic measures
were taken to maintain the secrecy of debate, and the
intrusion of a stranger was looked upon as a cause for grave
alarm. In 1584, a man named Robinson succeeded in
obtaining admission to the Commons, and sat in the House
unnoticed for two hours. When at last his presence was
discovered, Mr. Robinson was roughly handled by the
Sergeant-at-Arms, and, before he had time to utter his own
name, was "stript to the shirt" and searched.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Nothing of
an incriminating nature being found beneath the intruder's
clothing, he was brought to the bar, sworn to secrecy and
compelled to take the Oath of Supremacy before being finally
released with a severe reprimand. A hundred years later
two inoffensive but ignorant strangers walked into the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and sat quietly down beside the Sergeant-at-Arms. Here
they remained for some time, much impressed by the
hospitality of the Commons, until a division happened to be
called. Their presence was not observed until the lobby
doors had been finally locked, and they had to be hurried
out of the way by a side staircase to the Distinguished
Strangers' Gallery. Here they remained until the division
was over, and were subsequently dismissed with a caution.
In 1771, a stranger who had accidentally mingled with
the members in the lobbies was actually counted in a
division.</p>

<p>As time went on Parliament grew more and more
tolerant of the presence of strangers, and, though the order
forbidding their admission remained upon the order book of
the House of Commons, it soon came to be universally
disregarded.</p>

<p>In the old House members would sometimes be accompanied
by their sons, quite little boys, whom they would
carry to their seats beside them, and strangers could always
obtain a seat in the gallery by means of a written order given
them by a member, or by the simple method of slipping half-a-crown
into the hand of the attendant at the door. When
C. F. Moritz, the German traveller, visited the House in 1782,
he sought admission to the gallery, but, being unprovided
with a pass, was turned away. As he was sadly withdrawing
he heard the attendant murmur something of an apparently
irrelevant nature concerning a bottle of rum, but not until he
reached home did it occur to him that the remark might
possibly have some bearing upon the situation. The next
day, having been enlightened as to the general custom in
vogue among those who wished to be present during a debate,
he returned to the gallery. He had taken the wise precaution
of providing himself with a small sum of money. This he had
no difficulty in pressing upon the door-keeper, who at once
showed him into a front seat.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> No doubt Edmund Burke,
who in his youth spent so much time listening to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
debates and gaining that Parliamentary experience which was
afterwards destined to stand him in such good stead, unlocked
the gallery door with the same golden key.</p>

<p>Up to the year 1833 the doorkeepers and messengers of
the House of Commons were paid principally in fees and
gratuities. Members were called upon to contribute about
£9 per session towards a fund raised on their behalf, and
they received a small nominal salary of less than £13. The
doorkeepers earned farther payment by delivering the Orders
and Acts of the House to members, as well as various fees
from parliamentary agents, and were likewise entitled to a
quarter of the strangers' fees. In 1832 the two chief doorkeepers
were making between £800 and £900 a year, and
the chief messenger nearly £600. The man whose duty it
was to look after the room above the ventilator to which
ladies were admitted was not so successful as his colleagues,
and complained that he only received about £10 a year in
tips from the more economical sex.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>Pearson, for over thirty years doorkeeper in the old
House of Commons, was one of the most familiar figures in
and about St Stephen's Chapel during the latter part of the
eighteenth century. In his box near the gallery he sat&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Like a pagod in his niche;</span>
<span class="i0">The Gom-gom Pearson, whose sonorous lungs,</span>
<span class="i0">With 'Silence! Room there!' drown an hundred tongues."</span>
</div>

<p>Long service had given him a position of authority of
which he took every advantage. If a member were
negligent in the matter of paying the door-keeper his
fee, or treated that official in a manner which he considered
derogatory to his dignity, Pearson revenged himself
by sending the offender to the House of Lords or the
Court of Requests in search of imaginary friends. By such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
means he generally reduced the irritated member to submission,
and could extract a handsome present and a
promise of future politeness. Pearson had his own importance
so much at heart, as we read in his biography, that
he spurned a member's money unless he had previously
humbled the man. Long experience had enabled him to time
the length of a debate or even of an individual speech with
extraordinary accuracy. Members wishing to be informed
as to the probable hour of adjournment would ask him at
what time the Speaker had ordered his carriage. "The
Speaker has ordered his coach at eight," Pearson would
reply, "but I'll be d&mdash;&mdash;d if you get away before twelve!"<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Pearson's treatment of strangers was no less autocratic.
He could not always be corrupted into finding room for
them in the galleries unless he happened to take a fancy
to the appearance of the visitors. "If a face or a manner did
not please him," says his biographer, "gold could not bribe
him into civility, much less to the favour of admission.
One stranger might be modest and ingratiating; Pearson,
like Thurlow, would only give him a silent contemptuous
stare; another would be rude; Pearson would laugh at his
rudeness, tell him the orator of the moment, and, perhaps,
shove him in, although he had before refused dozens who
were known to him."<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>In the first year of Queen Victoria's reign a suggestion
was made that the public should be admitted without orders
of any kind. This idea was successfully opposed by Lord
John Russell, who expressed a fear that in such circumstances
the galleries would be filled with pickpockets and other
objectionable persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>Prior to 1867 strangers sometimes hired substitutes to
keep places for them in the crowd which thronged St.
Stephen's Hall on the morning of a big debate. These
representatives would arrive as early as 2.30 a.m., and, like
the messenger boys in the <i>queue</i> outside a modern theatre,
wait patiently until the door was opened in the afternoon.</p>

<p>In 1867 the system of balloting for seats in the Strangers'
Gallery was first instituted. Members had long been in the
habit of giving orders "to bearer," written on the backs of
envelopes or any scraps of paper, which were freely forged
and transferred from one visitor to another. Strangers who
were armed with these gallery passes were now compelled
to ballot for precedence, and though on important nights the
number of disappointed applicants was great, visitors gained
the advantage of not being kept waiting for hours on the
chance of obtaining a seat.</p>

<p>This system continued to obtain until the time of the
Fenian scares, in 1885, when, owing to the fact that two
strangers admitted to the Gallery on August 4th proved to
be well-known dynamiters, the police became alarmed for
the safety of the House. To prevent the recurrence of such
an unwelcome visit it was ordered that all applications for
admission should be made in writing to the Speaker's
secretary. The signatures of the strangers applying for
places could thus be verified by comparison with their
signatures in the Gallery book.</p>

<p>The deliberations of Parliament are supposed to be
secret, and, though the practice of avoiding publicity has
long fallen into disuse, it is still always possible for strangers
to be excluded should the occasion demand it. They were
not welcomed with effusion in either House, a century or
two ago. In 1740 Lord Chancellor Hardwicke declared to
the Lords that "another thing doth diminish the dignity of
the House; admitting all kinds of auditors to your debates.
This makes them be what they ought not to be, and gives
occasion to saying things which else would not be said."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
Thirty years later, as we have already seen, during a speech
of the Duke of Manchester's on the state of the nation,
Lord Gower rose and desired that the House of Lords should
be cleared of all who were not peers. The Duke of Richmond
strongly objected, considering this an insult to the members
of Parliament and others who were present. Chatham tried
in vain to address the House, and finally, as a dignified
protest, he and a score of other peers left the Chamber.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar scenes have occurred in the Lower
House. On one occasion, indeed, the members of the
popular assembly so far forgot themselves as to hurl epithets
of abuse at a distinguished stranger who was in their midst.
On February 22, 1837, Sheil made a violent attack in the
House of Commons upon ex-Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst,
the Irish Municipal Bill being under discussion at the time.
Lyndhurst had been accused of saying that three-quarters of
the people of Ireland were aliens in blood and only awaited
a favourable opportunity to cast off the government of
England as the yoke of a tyrannical oppressor, and this had
roused the Irish to fury. The ex-Chancellor happened to stroll
into the House of Commons while Sheil was speaking, and
took his seat below the bar. Immediately the Irish members
turned upon him, and for about ten minutes shouted insults
at the venerable statesman, who remained apparently unmoved
by the clamour.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>Up to within the last forty years it was quite sufficient
for a member of Parliament to inform the Speaker that he
"espied strangers" for the galleries to be instantly cleared.
On April 27, 1875, however, the cantankerous and obstructive
Mr. Biggar brought this rule into disrepute by calling the
Speaker's attention to the Strangers' Gallery at a time when
its occupants included the Prince of Wales and the German
Ambassador. In accordance with the regulations of the
House, these distinguished visitors were compelled to leave
forthwith. This quite gratuitous act of discourtesy on the
part of an extremely unpopular member was little to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
taste of the House. The sentiments of the majority were
aptly voiced by Disraeli when he begged Mr. Biggar to bear
in mind that the House was above all things "an assembly of
gentlemen." On the Prime Minister's motion, carried by a
unanimous vote, the Standing Order relative to the exclusion
of strangers was temporarily suspended, and the galleries
reopened. A resolution of Disraeli's was eventually adopted
whereby strangers could only be compelled to withdraw on
a division in favour of their exclusion, no debate or amendment
being permitted; though it was still left to the discretion
of the Speaker or Chairman to order their withdrawal
at any time and from any part of the House, if necessary.</p>

<p>Visitors to the House of Commons enter by St Stephen's
porch, where, until recently, they were interrogated by the
police constable on duty. If their answers proved satisfactory,
they were admitted to the Central Hall, whence they
dispatched printed cards inscribed with their names, addresses,
and the object of their visit, to such members as they desired
to see. The duty of ministering to the needs of friends who
were anxious to listen to the debates was one of the minor
discomforts of membership. There is a story of a member
of Parliament receiving a letter from a constituent asking
for a pass to the Speaker's Gallery or, if that were impossible,
six tickets to the Zoological Gardens. The natural
inference to be gathered from this request must be that the
House of Commons, which Lord Brougham once likened to
a menagerie, is capable of affording six times as much
entertainment as the monkey-house in Regent's Park.</p>

<p>Until the last session of 1908 members could obtain two
daily orders of admission for strangers from the Speaker's
secretary or the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Speaker's and
Strangers' Galleries (which were amalgamated in 1888) providing
accommodation for about one hundred and sixty
visitors. In the autumn of 1908, however, a man who wished
to advertise the cause of Female Suffrage&mdash;and incidentally
himself&mdash;threw a number of pamphlets down from the
gallery on to the floor of the House, and was summarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
ejected. This resulted in an order issued by the Speaker
that for the remainder of the session no strangers should be
admitted. The Strangers' Galleries were reopened in May
of the following year, and new regulations were framed to
prevent the recurrence of such a scene. Visitors are now
permitted to apply at a special bureau in St. Stephen's Hall,
at any time after 4.15 p.m. and, if there is room, are at once
admitted to the gallery without the formality of searching
for a member. Each stranger signs a declaration undertaking
to abstain from making any interruption or disturbance, and
to obey the rules for the maintenance of order in the galleries.</p>

<p>Applause, or the expression of any feeling, is strictly prohibited
in the Strangers' Gallery, and the attendants on duty
there have instructions to expel offenders without waiting for
any explanation of their conduct. In the commencement of
the last century a stranger once shouted, "You're a liar!"
while O'Connell was speaking, and was arrested by the
Sergeant-at-Arms and compelled to apologise the next day.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
Since that time, until recently, visitors have behaved with
commendable decorum.</p>

<p>The instances of strangers causing a commotion in Parliament
by extraordinary or improper behaviour are few in
number. The assassination of Spencer Perceval, the Prime
Minister, by a visitor in 1812 is undoubtedly the most tragic
event that has ever taken place within the precincts of the House
of Commons, the murderer being a mad Liverpool merchant,
named Bellingham, who had a grievance against the Government.
The recollection of this outrage almost gave rise to
a panic some years later when a wild-eyed, haggard man
rushed into the House while Sir Robert Peel was speaking,
and walked boldly up to the Minister. Stopping within a
few feet of the speaker, this alarming stranger made a low
bow. "I beg your pardon," he remarked suavely, "but I
am an unfortunate man who has just been poisoned by Earl
Grey!" He was at once removed to the nearest lunatic
asylum.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Other strangers have from time to time created a mild
consternation or amusement by some eccentricity of dress or
deportment. In 1833 a young Scotsman crossed the bar of
the Commons and sat deliberately down on a bench among
the members, where he remained undiscovered for some time.
In the same year a compatriot, garbed in full Highland
costume, unwittingly entered the side gallery reserved for
members, and prepared to listen to the debate from this
comfortable quarter. On being informed of his mistake, this
hardy Northman was so overcome with terror at the contemplation
of his crime and the consequences that would
probably ensue&mdash;nothing short of death could, he imagined,
be the punishment appropriate to such an offence&mdash;that he
took to his heels and ran like a hare, never pausing for breath
until he reached Somerset House, a mile and a half away.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
Sir Wilfrid Lawson in 1894 was shown a man in the Lobby
who had been turned out of the gallery for being drunk.
On asking what crime the stranger had committed, he was
told that he had said "Bosh!" to some of the speeches.
This, as Sir Wilfrid remarked, was not conclusive evidence
of drunkenness.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>A strange Irishman provided the peers with some amusement
in 1908 by appearing in the House of Lords attired in
a saffron-coloured kilt and toga which he claimed to be his
national costume, and which had doubtless been so ever since
the days of Darwin's missing link. He turned out to be harmless
enough, and, though momentarily disturbing to Black Rod's
peace of mind, did nothing more alarming than to provide
another example of the well-known fact that it is possible to
be a Celt and at the same time to lack a sense of humour.</p>

<p>Strangers of the male sex who visit the Upper House
may be accommodated in the large Strangers' Gallery facing
the throne, or, if members of Parliament, in the special
House of Commons' gallery, or at the bar. Privy councillors
and the eldest sons of peers are allowed to sit or stand upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the steps of the Throne, and there are special galleries set
apart for the use of the <i>corps diplomatique</i> and the Press.</p>

<p>The question of allowing women to attend the debates has
long presented difficulties to the parliamentary mind, though
at one time it was not unusual to see lady visitors actually
sitting in the Chamber itself side by side with their husbands
and friends. "Ought females to be admitted?" asked Jeremy
Bentham, many years ago, unhesitatingly answering his own
question in the negative a moment later. To remove them
from an assembly where tranquil reason ought alone to reign
was, as he explained, to avow their influence, and should not
therefore be wounding to their pride. "The seductions of
eloquence and ridicule are most dangerous instruments in a
political assembly," he says. "Admit females&mdash;you add new
force to these seductions." In the presence of the gentler sex,
Bentham suggests, everything must necessarily take an
exalted tone, brilliant and tragical&mdash;"excitement and tropes
would be scattered everywhere." All would be sacrificed to
vanity and the display of wit, to please the ladies in the
audience.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> If the serious business of debate were to be
sacrificed to "tropes," no doubt the British Constitution
would be considerably endangered; but experience has
taught us that the presence of ladies has not affected the
debates detrimentally, and the excitement caused in the
breasts of our legislators by the sight of a contingent of
the fair sex is not of a kind to prove alarming.</p>

<p>Women have taken a strong interest in political matters
in England from very early days.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> We even find them
giving occasional expression to their views upon some
Government measure with a violence which did not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
commend itself to the authorities. In the Journals of the
House for March 5, 1606, is the following entry: "A
Clamour of Women against Sir Robert Johnson, for speaking
against a Bill touching Wherry-men; upon complaint of
which the Commons ordered, that Notice should be given to
the Justices of the Peace, to prevent and suppress such
disorders."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> What steps the Justices of the Peace took to
quell this feminine clamour history does not relate. In 1675
some confusion was caused by the Speaker observing ladies
in the gallery, and though a member suggested that they
were not ladies at all, but merely men in fine clothes, the
Speaker insisted that he had caught sight of petticoats.</p>

<p>In the time of Queen Anne ladies were strongly infected
with the spirit of party. Addison declares that even the
patches they wore on their faces were so situated that the
political views of the wearer could be recognised at a glance.
Friends might be distinguished from foes in this delightful
fashion, Tory ladies wearing their patches on the left, Whigs
on the right side of the face. An old number of the
"Spectator"<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> contains the sad story of one Rosalinda, a
famous Whig partisan who suffered much annoyance on this
account. The fact that Rosalinda had a beautiful mole on
the Tory part of her forehead gave her enemies the chance
of misrepresenting her face as having revolted against the
Whig interest&mdash;an accusation which naturally depressed the
poor lady considerably.</p>

<p>The House of Lords has always been more hospitable
than the Commons in its treatment of women. The two side
galleries are reserved for peeresses&mdash;though a certain portion
is kept for members of the <i>corps diplomatique</i>, and for the
Commons&mdash;and there is a large box on the floor of the House
where the wives of peers' eldest sons sit, and a number of seats
below the bar to which Black Rod may introduce ladies.</p>

<p>The peers have not, however, been exempt from the
occasional inconveniences attaching to the presence of women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Lord Shaftesbury, during the term of his Lord Chancellorship,
complained bitterly of the "droves of ladies that attended all
causes," and said that things had reached such a pass that
men "borrowed or hired of their friends, handsome sisters or
daughters to deliver their petitions."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> And in 1739, the fair
Kitty, Duchess of Queensberry, headed a storming party and
successfully besieged a gallery in the House of Lords from
which ladies had been excluded in order to make room for
members of the Commons.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Grenville declares that the steps
of the Throne were inconveniently thronged with women in
1829. "Every fool in London thinks it necessary to be
there," he says. "They fill the whole space, and put themselves
in front, with their large bonnets, without either fear
or shame."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>In 1775, women were allowed to be present in Parliament
to listen to election petitions, and continued to be admitted
to the body of the House of Commons until 1778.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> In this
year a member named Captain Johnstone insisted that
strangers should withdraw, and the female section of the
audience absolutely declined to do so. Threats, entreaties,
all were useless. With the charming obstinacy of their
sex, the fair visitors clung to their seats, and refused to
budge an inch. Among the ladies who led this revolt
was the Duchess of Devonshire, and a celebrated beauty of
the name of Musters. They were assisted by a certain
number of male admirers, and, so successful were their
efforts, that two long hours elapsed before the galleries
could be cleared. This incident caused the Speaker to forbid
the future admittance of women, and until after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
fire of 1834, ladies could only listen to debates clandestinely,
and in a manner which entailed the maximum of personal
discomfort. Their absence does not seem to have had any
effect upon the length of the debates. "I was in hopes that
long speeches would have been knocked on the head when
the ladies were excluded from the galleries," said the doorkeeper;
"they often used to keep the members up."<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>When the Commons sat in the old St Stephen's Chapel,
that chamber was divided into two parts by a false roof.
The upper half consisted of a big empty room like a barn,
with unglazed windows. In the centre of the floor of this
apartment was the ventilating shaft of the House, a rough
casement with eight small openings, situated exactly above
the chandelier in the ceiling of the chamber below. To
this room were conducted the lady friends of members
desirous of catching a glimpse of the Commons at work.
The door was locked upon them, and they were permitted
to sit on a circular bench which surrounded the ventilator,
and peer down through the openings, while every now and
then their imprisonment would be lightened by a visit from
some kindly attendant, who would tell them the name of
the member addressing the House. The only light was
provided by a farthing dip stuck in a tin candlestick, and
the room was gloomy and depressing. It is an ill wind,
however, that blows nobody any good, and once when
O'Connell went up there expecting to find his wife, he

<p>Maria Edgeworth has left a description of a visit she
paid to this melancholy spot in 1822. "In the middle of
the garret," she says, "is what seemed like a sentry box of
deal boards, and old chairs placed round it; on these we
got, and stood and peeped over the top of the boards."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
From this vantage-point she could see the chandelier blazing
just beneath her, and below it again the Table, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
mace resting upon it, and the Speaker's polished boots&mdash;nothing
more.</p>

<p>The twenty-five tickets issued nightly by the Sergeant-at-Arms
for admission to this dungeon were much sought
after, a fact which testifies eloquently to the political enthusiasm
of our great-grandmothers.</p>

<p>In spite of the Speaker's order, ladies still continued
occasionally to find their way into more comfortable parts
of the House. Wraxall declares that he saw the famous
Duchess of Gordon sitting in the Strangers' Gallery dressed
as a man.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> And in 1834, a sister of some member entered
one of the side galleries, and sat there undisturbed for a long
time, the gallantry of the officials forbidding them to turn
her out.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>When the new Houses of Parliament were built, slightly
better accommodation was provided for the fair sex. It was
at first proposed that they should be seated in the open
galleries of the Commons, but this suggestion met with little
support. Miss Harriet Martineau, writing somewhere about
1876, prophesied pessimistically that if such a proposition
were carried out, the galleries would be occupied by giddy
and frivolous women, lovers of sensation, with plenty of time
upon their hands; "a nuisance to the Legislature and a serious
disadvantage to the wiser of their own sex."<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> This idea
seems to have been the popular one, and it was resolved to
keep the ladies who attended debates as much in the
background as possible.</p>

<p>The present gallery has many disadvantages. Its
occupants are enclosed in a cage which prevents them from
obtaining a good view of the proceedings, and altogether
conceals them from the gaze of the members. Repeated
attempts have been made to secure better accommodation,
notably by Mr. Grantley Berkeley, to whom a number of
ladies in 1841 presented a piece of plate in recognition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of his services on their behalf. The House is determined,
however, that its deliberations shall not be affected by the
presence of any disturbing element, agreeing apparently with
that member who assured the Speaker that if ladies were
permitted to sit undisguised in the gallery, "the feelings of
the gallant old soldiers and gentlemen would be so excited
and turned from political affairs, that they would not be able
to do their duty to their country."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>The suggestion has often been made that the grille should
be taken away from the front of the Ladies' Gallery, but it is
doubtful whether the removal of this screen would commend
itself to the visitors. Its retention bestows one undoubted
benefit upon them; it allows ladies to steal away unnoticed
during the speech of some bore, with whom they may be
personally acquainted, or whose feelings they would not like
to hurt. This is an advantage which cannot be esteemed too
highly.</p>

<p>The Ladies' Gallery, which, as has often been said, might be
called, but for its occupants, a veritable "chamber of horrors,"
is not considered to be within the House. Consequently,
when strangers are forced to withdraw, ladies may still remain.
They are even allowed to be present during prayers. The
feminine privilege of not being excluded with other strangers
is shared by the peers, who, since 1698, have always (with
the exception of a few years) had a gallery reserved for them.</p>

<p>Up to a short time ago members of the House of Commons
were allowed to introduce ladies to the inner lobby, whence
they could obtain a fragmentary glimpse of the proceedings
through a small window. This privilege was withdrawn in
1908, when a lady who was the guest of a member sought
to make some return for his hospitality by rushing on to the
floor of the House and shouting, "Votes for Women!"
Shortly before this two other ladies in the gallery, also the
guests of members, had attempted to prove the fitness of
their sex for the franchise by chaining themselves to the
grille and screaming. This was the first instance of unruly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
behaviour in the Ladies' Gallery since June of the year 1888,
when some women applauded a speech, much to the indignation
of Speaker Peel. It resulted in the closing of the gallery,
and the exclusion of all but the Speaker's own personal
guests, on whose sense of honour and decency he could rely.
In 1909, however, the Ladies' Gallery was once more thrown
open to members of the fair sex, tickets of admission being
confined to the relatives of members, who balloted for them
a week in advance. The ladies were required to sign an
undertaking to behave decorously while they occupied seats
in the gallery, and their exact relationship to members was
not inquired into too closely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>PARLIAMENTARY REPORTING</h3>


<p>Of all the strangers who honour the Palace of Westminster
with their presence none are treated with
greater consideration than the reporters. This touching
regard shown for the comfort of the Press is a flower of
modern growth. It has blossomed forth within the last fifty
years, watered by that love of publicity which is nowadays
as common in St. Stephen's as elsewhere. Journalists are in
the habit of complaining that the public no longer requires
those full reports of parliamentary utterances which a few
years ago were considered a very necessary part of the day's
news. Short political sketches have taken the place of full
verbatim reports, and very few papers give anything but
a rough outline of the daily parliamentary proceedings.
Politicians themselves, however, do not appear to share
the general aversion to reading their speeches in print, and it
is strange to contrast the warm welcome accorded by
Parliament to modern journalism with the cold reception met
with by reporters in the days of our ancestors.</p>

<p>In the Order Book of the House of Commons there still
exists a Standing Order which, though long in disuse, has
never been repealed, declaring it a gross breach of privilege
to print or publish anything relating to the proceedings of
either House. This is but a relic of those distant days when
the perpetual conflicts between the Commons and the Crown
made secrecy a necessity of debate.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
was anything but anxious that the result of its deliberations
should be made public, except in such a form as it considered
desirable. The Commons especially feared that information
as to their intentions should reach the King's ears, and took
every possible precaution to avert such a calamity. In this
they were not altogether successful. During the debates on
the proposed impeachment of the Duke of Buckingham, in
1626, members were very busy with their pencils. The
King himself had as many as four or five amateur note-takers
present to supply him with reports, and among
the private members were many other unofficial reporters.
Of these, perhaps, the most famous was Sir Symonds D'Ewes,
the member for Sudbury, a lawyer with only one eye,
devout, ambitious, conceited, and something of a snob.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
Records were, to his way of thinking, the most ravishing and
satisfying part of human knowledge. His historical researches
had given him an acquaintance with precedents
which was long the envy of his colleagues in Parliament.
In 1629 he transcribed the Journals of both Houses from the
original Journal books, adding comments of his own, and
inserting various interesting speeches which he obtained from
private manuscripts and diaries. When objections were raised
to his incorrigible <i>cacoethes scribendi</i>, "If you will not
permit us to write," he observed pathetically, "we must go to
sleep, as some among us do, or go to plays, as others have
done."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The contemplation of such tragic alternatives did
not, however, shake the resolution of the Commons, and the
practice of note-taking was put a stop to by a peremptory
order of the House.</p>

<p>Sir Symonds' peculiar knowledge of parliamentary
precedents resulted in his perpetual interference with the
procedure of the House. His frequent attempts to set the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Speaker right upon various points of order at length
irritated the Commons to the verge of madness, and it was
with a sigh of relief that his colleagues bade him farewell
when he reluctantly retired into private life to continue
uninterrupted his antiquarian pursuits.</p>

<p>Rushworth, who was Assistant Clerk of the Commons at
the time of the Long Parliament, proved almost as energetic
a reporter as D'Ewes, and thereby repeatedly got himself
into trouble. In 1642, he was forbidden to take any notes
without the sanction of the House, and a Committee was
appointed to look through his manuscripts and settle how
much of them was worthy of preservation. The result of
Rushworth's passion for reporting is the "Historical Collections,"
which Carlyle has called a "rag-fair of a book; the
mournfullest torpedo rubbish-heap of jewels buried under
sordid wreck and dust and dead ashes, one jewel to the
waggon-load."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> One of the undoubted gems from this dust-heap
is a full account of the proceedings in Parliament on
the famous occasion of Charles I.'s violent attempt to arrest
the five members. This dramatic incident does not appear
to have deprived Rushworth of his presence of mind. While
the Commons sat openmouthed and aghast, the Assistant
Clerk calmly continued to take notes of every word that fell
from the royal lips. For this posterity owes him a debt of the
deepest gratitude.</p>

<p>The right of Parliament to deliberate in secret was long
jealously guarded, any breach of that privilege being
punished with extreme severity. In 1641, an oration
delivered by Lord Digby on the Bill for Strafford's
attainder, and circulated on his own initiative, was ordered to
be burnt by the common hangman. At the same time it
was formally resolved that no member should publish any
speech without the express permission of the House.</p>

<p>In the reign of Charles II. such men as Shaftesbury,
Halifax, Hampden, and Hyde were not reported, though the
first would occasionally issue his speeches in pamphlet form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Towards the middle of the seventeenth century, however, the
House ordered utterances of exceptional importance to be
printed. During the Long Parliament licensed reports
appeared under the title of "Diurnal Occurrences of Parliament,"
and later on a meagre outline of the daily proceedings
of Parliament began to be published. But when Locke, in
1675, printed a report of a House of Lords' debate, calling it
"A letter from a Person of Quality to His Friend," it was
ordered by the Privy Council to be burnt.</p>

<p>The Licensing Act of 1662 confined printing to London,
York, Oxford, and Cambridge, and did not permit the
number of master printers to exceed twenty. The Commons'
refusal in 1695 to renew the censorship marks the commencement
of the emancipation of the Press.</p>

<p>A system of newsletters had been started with the
Restoration, whereby the outside world could learn something
of the doings of Parliament. This no doubt whetted the
public appetite, and increased the popular interest in political
affairs. In 1694, however, it was resolved in Parliament
that "no newsletter writers do in their letters or other papers
that they disperse presume to intermeddle with the debates
or any other proceedings of the House."</p>

<p>Newsletters were rapidly followed by regular newspapers,
which supplied their readers with somewhat imaginative
accounts of the debates. The periodicals of William III.'s
day sometimes reported the speeches of particular speakers,
who contributed their manuscripts to the papers. During
the factious years that followed, the debates were officially
distributed in monthly parts, but at the beginning of the
eighteenth century the publication of newspaper reports was
again declared a breach of parliamentary privilege, and a
stamp duty was imposed with a view to arresting the circulation
of the Opposition Press.</p>

<p>A regular party organ first appeared in Queen Anne's
reign. This was "The Examiner," subsidised by Harley's
Ministry, and conducted by Swift. It was answered by "The
Whig Examiner," edited by Addison, which was followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
"Manwaring's Medley," a paper which soon became the
recognised journal of the Opposition.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Towards the close of
Anne's reign Boyer began to publish "The Political State
of Great Britain" in which he included accounts of all the
important parliamentary debates.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> This was succeeded in 1716
by "The Historical Register," which purported to describe the
proceedings in both Houses. In the reports of the Commons'
debates the names of the speakers were published without
concealment, but the Lords were treated more cautiously.
Thus, in an account of the Septennial Bill, we find such
sentences as, "a noble Duke stood up and said," or "this
was answered by a northern peer," no further clue being
given as to the identity of the several speakers.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>"The Historical Register" was superseded twenty years later
by the "Gentleman's Magazine," a monthly periodical founded
by the bookseller Cave and edited by Guthrie. Cave used to
obtain admission to the House of Commons for himself and a
few friends, and would there take surreptitious notes of the
proceedings. These he subsequently elaborated in some
adjoining coffee-house, evolving lengthy and vivid descriptions
of the debates from his inner consciousness. His editor was
the first journalist to obtain access to the official parliamentary
Journals. The Government had apparently by this
time begun to regard the Press as a more or less necessary
evil, and thought it worth while to pay Guthrie a small sum
for his services, even providing him with a pension when he
retired.</p>

<p>The parliamentary articles in the "Gentleman's Magazine"
were published under the title of the "Senate of Lilliput,"
the real names of the various debaters being replaced
by pseudonyms which deceived nobody.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> This periodical is
famous as being the medium through which Dr. Johnson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
originally published his political views. When he was first employed
by Cave upon the staff of his paper Johnson was
still struggling, not for fame, but for existence, and had no
objection to any form of literary labour so long as it provided
him with a means of livelihood. His original duties consisted
in revising the rough notes made by Guthrie, but by 1740 he
had become entirely responsible for the parliamentary articles,
and five years later succeeded Guthrie in the editorial chair.</p>

<p>The reports of the proceedings were often written under
great difficulties. Dr. Johnson would at times be compelled
to invent the whole debate, depending solely upon his
imagination, and being provided with nothing more inspiring
than a list of the speakers and of the subjects under
discussion. "I wrote that in a garret!" he is always
supposed to have said of a much admired speech of Pitt's,
and perhaps the oratorical fame of many a statesman of that
day is due to Dr. Johnson's literary skill. His style was as
a rule far too perfect to pass for that of an ordinary member
of Parliament, and in his reports he is often accused of giving
not so much what the speakers said as what they ought to
have said. Nor was his pen an entirely impartial one, for he
always took care, as he explained to Boswell, that the "Whig
dogs" should not have the best of it in debate. Writing as
he did, very hurriedly and from scanty materials, the compilation
of parliamentary reports gave him little satisfaction.
As soon as he found that his debates were thought to be
genuine, he determined to cease their composition, and in the
later years of his life often expressed regret at having been
engaged in work of this kind.</p>

<p>The "London Magazine" was the next journal to publish
debates, imitating the methods of the "Gentleman's Magazine,"
by pretending to report the proceedings of an imaginary
Roman Senate, and alluding to the speakers by more or less
appropriate Latin names.</p>

<p>In spite of these various efforts to establish the liberty
of the Press, the attitude of Parliament long remained
antagonistic. In 1728 a fresh resolution was passed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
House declaring it to be a breach of privilege for any one to
print any account of the debates, and in the following year a
printer of Gloucester was summoned to the bar of the Lords
and severely reprimanded for publishing a report of their
proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> In 1738 Speaker Onslow brought up the subject
of parliamentary reporting in the Commons, and a debate
ensued. "If we do not put a speedy stop to this practice,"
said Winnington, "you will have the speeches of this House
every day printed, even during your session, and we shall be
looked upon as the most contemptible assembly on the face
of the earth." Pelham, however, was inclined to deal lightly
with the Press. "Let them alone," he said once, "they
make better speeches for us than we can make for ourselves."<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
But it was a long time before this sensible view became
general.</p>

<p>The struggle between Press and Parliament reached a
climax in 1771, when Wilkes's paper, the "North Briton," was
publishing the much discussed "Junius letters." Public
opinion was by this time becoming gradually alive to the
necessity for granting freedom to the Press, and needed
but the opportunity to express itself openly upon the subject.
The occasion had at length arrived. The Commons in this
year were much incensed at the behaviour of some wretched
City printers who had offended against the privileges of the
House, and despatched the Sergeant-at-Arms to arrest them.
After much difficulty two of the culprits were apprehended,
but on being taken before the City Aldermen the latter at
once ordered their release. When a messenger from the
House of Commons attempted to arrest another printer, he
was himself seized and carried before the civic authorities,
charged with assault. The House was furious at this
treatment of their officer, and committed the Lord Mayor
and one of the offending aldermen&mdash;both members of
Parliament&mdash;to the Tower.</p>

<p>The Press on this occasion found a worthy champion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Edmund Burke. On the 2nd of March, in a debate which
lasted twenty-two hours, Burke effectually held his own, and
so bullied and ridiculed the House that he brought the whole
business to a standstill. By continually forcing divisions and
making use of other obstructive tactics, he managed to delay
the parliamentary attempt to muzzle the Press, and gained a
great victory for the cause of freedom.</p>

<p>From being actively disliked the Reporters gradually grew
to be tolerated, and finally courted and cultivated. Members
who had formerly objected to the publication of their speeches
soon began to complain with equal bitterness that they were
not reported at all. Others, again, grumbled at being misreported,
words being attributed to them for which they
altogether declined to be responsible. Wedderburn, afterwards
Lord Loughborough, complained, in 1771, that the
reporting in the Commons was shocking. Of the report of
one speech which he was supposed to have delivered he said
that "to be sure, there are in that report a few things which
I did say, but many things which I am glad I did not say,
and some things which I wish I could have said."<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Burke's
famous sentiment that "Virtue does not depend on climates
or degrees" was first printed as "on <i>climaxes</i> and <i>trees</i>."
When Sheridan made his great speech at the trial of
Warren Hastings, the "Morning Chronicle" reported him as
having said that "nothing equal in criminality was to be
traced either in ancient or modern history, in the correct
periods of Tacitus, or the luminous page of Gibbon."<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The
historian was delighted at being mentioned in so flattering
a fashion; "I could not hear without emotion the personal
compliment," he says in his autobiography. But when
Sheridan was asked how he came to apply the epithet
"luminous" to Gibbon, "I said Vo-luminous!" he replied
shortly.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>Cobbett, too, suffered much from bad reporting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
when he ventured to find fault, the Press retaliated by
ceasing to report him at all. Spring-Rice (afterwards Lord
Monteagle) was punished in a similar fashion for two years,
because he had said something deprecatory of journalism.
Another member complained that his speeches had been
published in the papers with certain of the sentences printed
in italics. "I never spoke in italics in my life!" he exclaimed
indignantly.</p>

<p>O'Connell in 1833 accused a reporter of wilfully perverting
one of his speeches. By way of excuse the Pressman
stated that on his way home from the House he had been
caught in a shower of rain, which had washed out many of
his notes. This explanation did not satisfy the Liberator,
who justly remarked that it must surely have been an extraordinary
shower which could not only wash out one speech,
but actually wash in another!<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> He was never a favourite of
the Press, and they finally decided to discontinue the report
of his speeches. As a means of revenge, he determined to
prevent all newspaper reporting, and for some time succeeded
in doing so. With this end in view, he made a practice of
"espying strangers" on every opportunity, and each time he
did so the galleries had to be cleared. The withdrawal of
the reporters had a natural but most depressing effect upon
the oratory of Parliament. "For the first time within my
recollection," says Grant, "members kept their word when,
on commencing their orations, they promised not to trespass
at any length on the patience of the House."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>The "Diary," published in 1769, and edited by William
Woodfall, was the first paper to give accounts of the parliamentary
debates on the day after they had taken place.
Woodfall had a marvellous memory, and would sit in the
gallery or stand at the bar of either House for hours, without
taking a note of any kind, and afterwards reproduce the
speeches verbatim. He seemed not to require rest or refreshment,
but occasionally fortified himself with a hard-boiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
egg. His efforts were, however, spasmodic and irregular, and
it was not until 1802, when William Cobbett started the
"Weekly Political Register," which afterwards published the
debates as supplements under the title of "Cobbett's Parliamentary
Debates," that the system of providing regular
reports of the proceedings was inaugurated. In 1809 the
publication of the "Weekly Political Register" was transferred
to T. C. Hansard, whose name has been so long and honourably
connected with parliamentary reporting that it is still
used colloquially to describe the official volumes.</p>

FROM THE PAINTING BY THOMAS BEACH IN THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY</span>
</div>

<p>For over fifty years Hansard carried on the publication of
debates as a private speculation, by which time the Government
had realised the useful nature of his labours, and
assisted him by subscribing for a certain number of sets of
the reports for public distribution. In 1877 a Treasury grant
was made to enable him to continue the good work with
greater fullness and facility, and twelve years later he sold
his rights to a syndicate. This new venture proved anything
but a financial success, and the publication of the "Parliamentary
Debates," as they are now called, was then undertaken
by the official Government printers, the reports being
composed from notes furnished by the staff of the "Times."</p>

<p>It was not until 1909 that the present system was instituted,
and both Houses, while leaving the printing of debates
in the hands of the King's Printer, provided themselves with
a regular staff of reporters, who were their own officials and
unconnected with any company or newspaper.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the Fire, reporters in the Commons
always sat in the back row of the Strangers' Gallery, to
which they obtained admission by a sessional payment of
three guineas. In 1831, the House of Lords provided
separate accommodation for the Press, and in the temporary
House which was constructed in 1834 a special gallery was
reserved for their use.</p>

<p>The Press Gallery in the present House of Commons
holds about sixty persons, and is situated exactly behind
and above the Speaker's chair. Reporters of the newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
in the Lords occupy a similar position, but as the acoustic
properties of the Upper Chamber are notoriously bad, a
special arrangement has existed for some years, whereby the
official reporter of the "Parliamentary Debates" is given a
seat on the floor of the House immediately behind the Clerks
at the Table.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago the path of the Pressman was not
so smooth as it is to-day. Up to 1840 the publication of
debates was undertaken at the risk of the printer. In that
year Hansard published the report of a Select Committee of
the House of Commons, in which a certain book was referred
to as "disgusting and obscene." Stockdale, the publisher of
the book in question, took the matter into Court and obtained
£600 damages for libel. The House retorted by summoning
to the bar the Sheriffs of Middlesex who had tried the case,
and reprimanded them for their contempt of its privileges.
After this Lord John Russell took the first opportunity of
introducing a Bill rendering all publication of speeches and
documents, if by the authority of Parliament, matters of
privilege not amenable to ordinary law. A member of
Parliament cannot, however, claim privilege for publishing
or circulating the report of any libellous speech made in the
House, though he is, of course, protected there for anything
he may say. The suggestion that privilege of Parliament
should protect members from being proceeded against for
writing and publishing libellous articles was discussed
in November, 1763, and finally relinquished by a large
majority.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>The subject of reporting cannot be left without some mention
of that official amateur reporter who sits upon the Treasury
bench and prepares his nightly précis of the day's parliamentary
proceedings. Amateur reporters there have always been
in the Commons from the days of Sir Symonds D'Ewes and
Sir Henry Cavendish<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> to the present time; but there is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
one upon the floor of the House whose duties have ever been
officially recognised.</p>

<p>In accordance with a custom of many years standing
the Leader of the House of Commons writes a nightly letter
to the sovereign, whenever the House is sitting, giving a
brief <i>résumé</i> of the debates. This letter, often composed
somewhat hastily during the course of an exciting debate, is
at once sent off in an official dispatch box to His Majesty, and
is subsequently filed in the library at Buckingham Palace.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
The practice dates from the reign of George III., who required
George Grenville, then Leader of the House of Commons, to
provide him with daily reports of the debates relating to the
contest between Parliament and John Wilkes.</p>

<p>The sovereign is not supposed to enter the Lower House&mdash;Charles
I. was the only monarch who broke this rule&mdash;and
thus, in days before debates were published at length in the
papers, the Crown had no means of ascertaining the doings of
the Commons save through the medium of this letter. The
need for this one-sided nightly correspondence no longer
exists, but the custom still prevails, and adds one more to the
already multifarious duties of the Leader of the House, though
nowadays it is occasionally delegated to some other Minister,
or to one of the Whips.</p>

<p>To-day Press and Parliament are mutually dependent. A
great newspaper proprietor who was recently asked which of
the two he considered to be the most powerful, found
some difficulty in replying. "The Press is the voice without
which Parliament could not speak," he said. "On the other
hand, Parliament is the law-making machine without which
the Press could not act." The question of their relative power
and importance must be left to the decision of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
judgment and taste. "Give me but the liberty of the Press,"
said Sheridan in 1810, in answer to the Premier, Spencer
Perceval, "and I will give the Minister a venal House of
Peers, I will give him a corrupt and servile House of Commons,
I will give him the full swing of the patronage of office, I will
give him the whole host of ministerial influences, I will give
him all the power that place can confer upon him to purchase
submission and overawe resistance; and yet, armed with the
liberty of the Press, I will go forth to meet him undismayed;
I will attack the mighty fabric he has reared with that
mightier engine; I will shake down from its height corruption,
and lay it beneath the ruins of the abuses it was meant to
shelter!"<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

between Lords Ashtown and Farnham. Such a thing had not happened
since the Union. The difficulty was settled in a manner only perhaps
possible in an institution as venerable as the House of Lords. In
accordance with the provisions of the Act of Union, the Clerk of the
Parliaments wrote the names of the candidates on two pieces of paper
which he then put into a glass. One of these he drew out at random,
and the peer whose name was inscribed thereon was declared to be duly
elected.</p></div>

1909, a Cabinet Minister's allusion in a speech to certain newspaper
proprietors whom a Conservative Prime Minister had "taken the
precaution to make into barons" inspired the King's private Secretary to
write a letter to a correspondent in which he stated that, notwithstanding

Government persuading the Crown to create a number of peerages
sufficient to flood the House with peers of their particular political
persuasion. In 1712, Queen Anne was prevailed upon to create twelve
peers in a single day, in order to pass a Government measure. "If these
twelve had not been enough," said Bolingbroke, "we could have given
them another dozen!" William IV. was prepared to create a hundred
new peers to ensure the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832. It remains
to be seen whether such an idea is nowadays practicable.</p></div>

office of state, is the custodian of the Palace of Westminster. He was
originally an executive officer of the King's household, appointed to look
after the royal residence. In 1133 the office was granted by Henry I. to
Aubrey de Vere, father of the first Earl of Oxford, and to his heirs.
Henry VIII. gave the post on several occasions for life to different
favourites, not necessarily of the De Vere family, but since the time of
Elizabeth the Lord Great Chamberlainship has been held without exception
by descendants of the Earl of Oxford. To-day the families of
Cholmondeley on the one side, and Ancaster and Carrington on the
other, share the privileges of the office, a representative of each branch
holding the Chamberlainship in turn during the lifetime of alternate
sovereigns. The Lord Great Chamberlain retains authority over the
buildings of both Houses, even during the session, whenever Parliament
is not sitting. Here his official responsibilities end. In former
times a considerable part of his duties consisted in attending his
sovereign at the Coronation, when he was not only expected to dress the
King, to "carry the coif, swords, and gloves, etc."; but also to undress
him, and to wait on him at dinner, "having for his fee the King's bed
and all the furniture of his chamber, the night apparel and the silver
basin wherein the King washes, with the towels." It is traditional
that if the King sleeps at Westminster he must occupy the Lord
Great Chamberlain's house. George IV. did so on the eve of his Coronation,
the Speaker of the House of Commons handing over his residence
for the purpose to the Lord Great Chamberlain for a nominal fee. On
this occasion the officials in waiting on His Majesty spent a restless night.
Lord Gwydyr, the Deputy Lord Great Chamberlain, and his secretary,
took their stand on one side of the King's chamber, and the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod on the other, and there they remained until
morning. (See "The Gentleman's Magazine." July, 1821.)</p></div>

within the scope of this volume. It will be sufficient to enumerate briefly
the most important members of the administration. First in order of
precedence stand the Prime Minister, the Lord High Chancellor, the
Lord President of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal (an office to which,
like that of the Prime Minister, no salary is attached), and the First
Lords of the Treasury and Admiralty. After these come the five
Secretaries of State: for Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, the Colonies,
War, and India. These are followed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
the Secretaries for Scotland and Ireland, the Postmaster-General, the
Presidents of the Board of Trade, Local Government Board, Board of
Agriculture, and Board of Education, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, and the First Commissioner of Works. There are, besides,
eight Parliamentary Under-Secretaries, four Junior Lords of the Treasury
(one of whom is unpaid), a Patronage Secretary, a Financial Secretary,
a Paymaster-General, Attorney-General, and Solicitor-General. Scotland
is represented by a Lord-Advocate and a Scottish Solicitor-General;
Ireland by a Lord-Lieutenant, a Lord Chancellor, an Attorney-General,
and a Solicitor-General.</p></div>

to puns. When Lord Campbell replaced Lord Plunket as Chancellor
of Ireland he had to cross the Channel in a storm. Plunket's secretary
remarked that if the new Chancellor were not drowned, he would be
very sick. "Perhaps," said Plunket, "he'll throw up the seals!" Lord
Chancellor Westbury once told an eminent counsel that he was getting
as fat as a porpoise. "In that case," replied the other, "I am evidently
a fit companion of the great Seal." Lord Lyndhurst is another Chancellor
who made a joke of this sort. There must be something, too, in the
atmosphere of a change of Ministry which evokes bad puns. When
Disraeli was appointed to Lord Derby's Cabinet in 1852, more than one
eminent politician facetiously remarked that now Benjamin's mess would
be five times as great as that of the others. And, fourteen years later,
when the same statesman was bidden to form a Ministry of his own, Lord
Chelmsford, whom he had relieved of the Chancellorship of the Exchequer,
shamelessly observed that if the old Government was "the
Derby," this new one was certainly "the Hoax" (see Martin's "Life
of Lyndhurst," p. 481 n., and the "Life of Lord Granville," vol. i.
p. 479, etc.).</p></div>

the offer of a reward of £200 failed to retrieve it. When Lord Chancellor
Eldon's house at Encombe caught fire in 1812, he buried the Seal for
safety's sake in the garden, and then forgot where he had buried it. His
family spent most of the next day digging for it before it was finally recovered.
Eldon seems to have taken the fire very easily. "It really
was a very pretty sight," he wrote, "for all the maids turned out of their
beds, and formed a line from the water to the fire-engine, handing the
buckets; they looked very pretty, <i>all in their shifts</i>." Campbell's "Lives

For denying that the sacramental blood and wine lost their material

the Lord Chancellor with his own hands stretched the rack on which the
unfortunate woman was bound, in the hope of extracting a confession.

would only lead a man to court popular reputation, and avoid popular
disgrace, whether the opinion on which they are founded is false or true;
whether the conduct which they require is in itself just or unjust, or its
consequences hurtful or beneficial to mankind. I mean a quality which
is not satisfied with doing right, when it is merely the alternative of doing
wrong, which prompts a man to do what he might lawfully and honestly
leave undone; which distinguishes a thousand different shades in what

firm, who were asked to make 3000 more of similar pattern. They
thought the order suspicious, and consulted the Secretary of State.
Burke happened to call at the latter's office, saw the dagger there, and
borrowed it. During the Second Reading of the Aliens Bill he hurled
this weapon on to the floor of the House, exclaiming, "Let us keep
French principles from our heads, and French daggers from our hearts!"
The Commons were not impressed, and only laughed, while Sheridan
whispered to a neighbour, "The gentleman has brought us the knife,
but where is the fork?" Another attempt at dramatic effect, equally
unsuccessful, occurred on the second reading of the Reform Bill in 1831.
Lord Brougham spoke for four hours, fortified by frequent draughts of
mulled port. At the end he exclaimed, "By all the ties that bind every
one of us to our common order and our common country, I solemnly
adjure you&mdash;yea, on my bended knees, I supplicate you&mdash;reject not this
Bill!" With these words he fell upon his knees, and remained in this
attitude so long that his friends, fearing that he was suffering as
much from mulled port as emotion, picked him up and replaced him on
the Woolsack.</p></div>

words of the Oath in too literal a sense. Walpole became possessed of
some treasonable letters written by William Shippen, a Jacobite and
violent opponent of his. Walpole sent for Shippen, and burnt the
incriminating papers in his presence. Later on, when Shippen was taking
the oath of allegiance in the Commons, Walpole, who stood near and
knew the other's principles to be as treasonable as ever, smiled. "Egad!
Robin," said Shippen, "that's hardly fair!"</p></div>

the commencement of the fourteenth century. It was originally held by
an ecclesiastic, to whom were assigned, in times when the two Houses sat
together, the clerical work of Parliament. The Clerk of the Parliaments
is appointed by the Crown under Letters Patent, and can only be removed
by the Crown on an address from the House of Lords. Up to the year
1855, the post was a lucrative sinecure, worth about £7000 a year, the
actual duties of the office being performed by the Clerk Assistant. At
the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Clerk of the Parliaments
enjoyed the privilege of nominating and appointing all the clerks on
the House of Lords establishment, but in 1824 the appointment of the two
other Clerks at the Table was transferred to the Lord Chancellor. He
still, however, appoints all the other clerks, regulates and controls the
duties and promotion of the staff, appoints the Librarian and his assistant,
and exercises superintendence over the Library and the Refreshment
Department of the House. It is his duty to attend all the sittings of
the House, to call on the Orders of the Day, and to invite peers
to bring forward their Bills or Motions. He also performs functions
analogous to those of the Speaker in the Commons, when he signs
Addresses to the sovereign, other Addresses of thanks or condolence, the
minutes of the daily proceedings, and all the returns ordered by the
House. As registrar of the Court of Final Appeal, he takes the instructions
of the judicial authorities upon all questions relating to appeals,
and keeps a record of all judgments, etc. Lastly, and this is perhaps
not the least important of his duties, he gives the Royal Assent to Bills.</p></div>

Ministerial majority by about forty. The Opposition teller watched the
error with a smile, but did not feel called upon to correct it. See "The
